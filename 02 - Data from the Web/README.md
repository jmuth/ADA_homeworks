# Homework 2

For this homework, we have different files. You will find a brief explanation for each files.

### Scraping\_IsAcadmia.ipynb

In this notebook, you will find the functions used to scrap the data from Is Academia. Everything is explained step by step. The data are stored in CSV files (one for each year) in the folder data.

### Exercise0\_Semestre\_Automne\_and\_Semestre\_Printemps.ipynb

In this notebook, we wanted to check if the entries "*Semestre automne*" and "*Semestre printemps*" were corresponding to something useful. We did a bit of data analysis on these entries to check if they were exchange students, or other. 

### Exercise1.ipynb

In this notebook, we did the first exercise on the "*Bachelor*" students. We did a first analysis without a lot of assumptions and then we added more assumptions to check if it was changing something.

### Exercise2.ipynb

In this notebook, we did the second exercise on the "*Master*" students. We first did an analysis using the entry "*Master semestre 1*". We found some results on the Specilization. Then, we did the bonus exercise and plotted the graph. Finally, we tried a more robust analysis using the entry "*Projet Master automne*" and "*Projet Master printemps*". This analysis reduced a lot the number of students but gave some interesting results.
