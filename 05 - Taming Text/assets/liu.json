AM\nAnne-Marie Slaughter is a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton.\nBy Anne-Marie Slaughter\nPRESIDENT Obama says the noose is tightening around Col. Muammar al-Qaddafi. In fact, it is\ntightening around the Libyan rebels, as Colonel Qaddafi makes the most of the world's dithering and\nsteadily retakes rebel-held tow.ns, The United States and Europe are temporizing on a no-flight zone\nwhile the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Gulf Cooperation Council and now the Arab\nLeague have all called on the United Nations Security Council to authorize one. Opponents of a no-\nflight zone have put forth five main arguments, none of which, on closer examination, hold up.\nIt's not in our interest. Gen. Wesley K. Clark argues that \"Libya doesn't sell much oil to the United\nStates\" and that while Americans \"want to support democratic movements in the region,\" they are\nalready doing that in Iraq and Afghanistan. Framing this issue in terms of oil is exactly what Arab\npopulations and indeed much of the world expect, which is why they are so cynical about our\nprofessions of support for democracy and human rights. Now we have a chance to support a new\nbeginning in the Muslim world \u2014 a new beginning of accountable governments that can provide\nservices and opportunities for their citizens in ways that could dramatically decrease support for\nterrorist groups and violent extremism. It's hard to imagine something more in our strategic interest.\nIt will be counter-productive. Many thoughtful commentators, including Al Jazeera's director\ngeneral, Wadah Khanfar, argue that what is most important about the Arab spring is that it is coming\nfrom Arabs themselves. From this perspective, Western military intervention will play right into\nQaddati's hands, allowing him to broadcast pictures of Western bombs falling on Arab civilians. But\nthese arguments, while important, must be weighed against the appeals of of Libyan opposition\nfighters asking for international help, and now, astonishingly, against support for a no-flight zone by\nsome of the same governments that have kept their populations quiescent by holding up the specter of\nforeign intervention. Assuming that a no-flight zone can be imposed by an international coalition that\nincludes Arab states, we have an opportunity to establish a new narrative of Western support for Arab\ndemocrats.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739568\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nIt won't work. The United States ambassador to NATO, Ivo H. Daaider, argues that stopping\nColonel Qaddafi's air force will not be decisive; he will continue to inflict damage with tanks and\nhelicopters, bombing oil refineries and depots on his way to retaking key towns. But the potential\neffect of a no-flight zone must also be assessed in terms of Colonel Qaddafi's own calculations about\nhis future. Richard Downie of the Center for Strategic and International Studies argues that although\nColonel Qaddafi cultivates a mad-dictator image, he has been a canny survivor and political\nmanipulator for 40 years. He is aware of debates with regard to a no-flight zone and is timing his\nmilitary campaign accordingly; he is also capable of using his air force just enough to gain strategic\nadvantage, but not enough to trigger a no-flight zone. If the international community lines up against\nhim and is willing to crater his runways and take out his antiaircraft weapons, he might well renew his\noffer of a negotiated departure.\nIf it does work, we don't know what we will get. Revolutions are almost always followed by internal\ndivisions among the revolutionaries. We should not expect a rosy, Jeffersonian Libya. But the choice\nis between uncertainty and the certainty that if Colonel Qaddafi wins, regimes acrosS the region will\nconclude that force is the livay to answer protests. And when Colonel Qaddafi massacres the\nopposition, young protesters across the Middle East will conclude that when we were asked to support\ntheir cause with more than words, we blinked. Americans in turn will read the words of Mr. Obama's\nJune 2009 speech in Cairo., with its lofty promises to stand for universal human rights, and cringe.\nLet's arm the rebels instead. Some commentators who agree with the analysis above say we could\n'better accomplish our goals by providing intelligence and arms to the opposition. That would, of\ncourse, be much easier for us. It undoubtedly appeals to Mn Obama as a neat compromise between\nthe desire to help the protesters and the desire not to overrule his defense secretary's reluctance to\nparticipate in a no-flight zone. But we would be providing arms not to a disciplined military, but to\nragged groups of brave volunteers who barely know how to use the weapons they have. They need\naction that will change the situation on. the ground for Colonel Qaddafi, as well as his the calculations.\nMoreover, by the time arms and intelligence could take effect, it is quite likely that Colonel Qaddafi\nwill have retaken or at least besieged .Benghazi, the opposition stronghold.\nThe United States should immediately ask the Security Council to authorize a no-flight zOne and\nmake clear to Russia and China that if they block the resolution, the blood of the Libyan opposition\nwill be on their hands. We should push them at least to abstain and bring the issue to a vote as soon as\npossible. If we get a resolution, we should work with the Arab League to quickly assemble an\ninternational coalition to impose the no-flight zone. If the Security Council fails toact, then we should\nrecognize the opposition Interim National Council as the legitimate Libyan government, as France has\ndone, and work with the Arab League to give the council any assistance it requests:\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739568\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

What we heard is accurate. More: Labour will suffer a large\ndefeat in the European elections on June 4. (New poll in Guardian shows widespread disaffection\nwith all parties as a result of the Commons expenses scandal; 27 percent voting for fringe parties.)\nGordon will attempt to overwhelm news coverage of the loss with a cabinet reshuffle, as early as the\nnext day, June 5. The plot (sounds like the Tudors): David is the target, from multiple angles and\nmotives, personal ambition mixed with anti-Blairism. Peter has always wanted to be Foreign\nSecretary, a job held by his grandfather, Herbert Morrison. (Morrison was also deputy PM, why\ndoesn't Peter want that?) New Labour people regard Peter as more ambitious than New Labour at\nthis point. He supported Gordon's utterly misbegotten and wildly unpopular proposal to raise the top\ntax rate to 50 percent. The fallout is less resentment of the affluent to paying more or grudging\nunderstanding of need for new revenues as it is a sense that Labour under Gordon is abandoning the\nproject for social aspiration and opportunity that is at the heart of the New Labour message. Ed Balls,\none of Gordon's closest longtime advisers, is also determined to topple David. Balls is a\ncontemporary of David's, wants to be leader of the party himself, and continues the Gordon v. Tony\nbitter rivalry into the future. Balls is currently Minister for Children and Schools and was linked to\nDamian McBride (Gordon's hatchetman, who has trashed Blairites, got caught out on his blogging\nscheme to smear Cameron). If Gordon names Peter to David's job, Balls would take Peter's and\nbecome Business Secretary. David would be pushed into Home Secretary. Once Balls takes Peter's\njob, Balls will likely reverse Peter's privatization proposal for the Royal Mail to win support from party's\nleft-wing base, beginning of his campaign against David for post-Gordon leadership struggle. Tony\nsees the situation as terminal. Hope to speak with him soon. He is trying to become President of\nEurope if and when Lisbon treaty passes.

AM\nAnne-Marie Slaughter is a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton.\nBy Anne-Marie Slaughter\nPRESIDENT Obama says the noose is tightening around Col. Muammar al-Qaddafi. In fact, it is\ntightening around the Libyan rebels, as Colonel Qaddafi makes the most of the world's dithering and\nsteadily retakes rebel-held tow.ns, The United States and Europe are temporizing on a no-flight zone\nwhile the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Gulf Cooperation Council and now the Arab\nLeague have all called on the United Nations Security Council to authorize one. Opponents of a no-\nflight zone have put forth five main arguments, none of which, on closer examination, hold up.\nIt's not in our interest. Gen. Wesley K. Clark argues that \"Libya doesn't sell much oil to the United\nStates\" and that while Americans \"want to support democratic movements in the region,\" they are\nalready doing that in Iraq and Afghanistan. Framing this issue in terms of oil is exactly what Arab\npopulations and indeed much of the world expect, which is why they are so cynical about our\nprofessions of support for democracy and human rights. Now we have a chance to support a new\nbeginning in the Muslim world \u2014 a new beginning of accountable governments that can provide\nservices and opportunities for their citizens in ways that could dramatically decrease support for\nterrorist groups and violent extremism. It's hard to imagine something more in our strategic interest.\nIt will be counter-productive. Many thoughtful commentators, including Al Jazeera's director\ngeneral, Wadah Khanfar, argue that what is most important about the Arab spring is that it is coming\nfrom Arabs themselves. From this perspective, Western military intervention will play right into\nQaddati's hands, allowing him to broadcast pictures of Western bombs falling on Arab civilians. But\nthese arguments, while important, must be weighed against the appeals of of Libyan opposition\nfighters asking for international help, and now, astonishingly, against support for a no-flight zone by\nsome of the same governments that have kept their populations quiescent by holding up the specter of\nforeign intervention. Assuming that a no-flight zone can be imposed by an international coalition that\nincludes Arab states, we have an opportunity to establish a new narrative of Western support for Arab\ndemocrats.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739568\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nIt won't work. The United States ambassador to NATO, Ivo H. Daaider, argues that stopping\nColonel Qaddafi's air force will not be decisive; he will continue to inflict damage with tanks and\nhelicopters, bombing oil refineries and depots on his way to retaking key towns. But the potential\neffect of a no-flight zone must also be assessed in terms of Colonel Qaddafi's own calculations about\nhis future. Richard Downie of the Center for Strategic and International Studies argues that although\nColonel Qaddafi cultivates a mad-dictator image, he has been a canny survivor and political\nmanipulator for 40 years. He is aware of debates with regard to a no-flight zone and is timing his\nmilitary campaign accordingly; he is also capable of using his air force just enough to gain strategic\nadvantage, but not enough to trigger a no-flight zone. If the international community lines up against\nhim and is willing to crater his runways and take out his antiaircraft weapons, he might well renew his\noffer of a negotiated departure.\nIf it does work, we don't know what we will get. Revolutions are almost always followed by internal\ndivisions among the revolutionaries. We should not expect a rosy, Jeffersonian Libya. But the choice\nis between uncertainty and the certainty that if Colonel Qaddafi wins, regimes acrosS the region will\nconclude that force is the livay to answer protests. And when Colonel Qaddafi massacres the\nopposition, young protesters across the Middle East will conclude that when we were asked to support\ntheir cause with more than words, we blinked. Americans in turn will read the words of Mr. Obama's\nJune 2009 speech in Cairo., with its lofty promises to stand for universal human rights, and cringe.\nLet's arm the rebels instead. Some commentators who agree with the analysis above say we could\n'better accomplish our goals by providing intelligence and arms to the opposition. That would, of\ncourse, be much easier for us. It undoubtedly appeals to Mn Obama as a neat compromise between\nthe desire to help the protesters and the desire not to overrule his defense secretary's reluctance to\nparticipate in a no-flight zone. But we would be providing arms not to a disciplined military, but to\nragged groups of brave volunteers who barely know how to use the weapons they have. They need\naction that will change the situation on. the ground for Colonel Qaddafi, as well as his the calculations.\nMoreover, by the time arms and intelligence could take effect, it is quite likely that Colonel Qaddafi\nwill have retaken or at least besieged .Benghazi, the opposition stronghold.\nThe United States should immediately ask the Security Council to authorize a no-flight zOne and\nmake clear to Russia and China that if they block the resolution, the blood of the Libyan opposition\nwill be on their hands. We should push them at least to abstain and bring the issue to a vote as soon as\npossible. If we get a resolution, we should work with the Arab League to quickly assemble an\ninternational coalition to impose the no-flight zone. If the Security Council fails toact, then we should\nrecognize the opposition Interim National Council as the legitimate Libyan government, as France has\ndone, and work with the Arab League to give the council any assistance it requests:\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739568\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

In exchange, she said, African leaders must deliver democracy and good government.\nMrs. Clinton vowed to stay on top of Africa, even after she gets back to Washington, closely monitoring the issues she\naddressed on her tour. She also pointed to Cape Verde, a set of palm-studded islands best known for their beaches and\nenormous tourist hotels, as an example of what good leadership can do.\n\"This is possible,\" she said. \"You create not just economic growth but a sense of human dignity and possibility.\"\nKenya. South Africa. Angola. Congo. Nigeria. Liberia. And finally Cape Verde. Mrs. Clinton saw with her own eyes some of\nAfrica's most promising countries - and some of its most troubled ones. In Kenya, she pushed for the government to\nprosecute perpetrators of the postelection violence last year. In South Africa, the big issue was Zimbabwe and how the\nSouth African government should do more to help ease the crisis there.\nIn Angola, the theme was good governing practices and oil, a strategic concern of the United States given the many\ninroads China has made there and elsewhere in Africa in its hunger for natural resources. In Congo, Mrs. Clinton was\npassionate about the need to end the nation's rape epidemic.\n\"The secretary's visit to the heart of the world's deadliest war zone in eastern Congo was a potential game-changer for\nthat conflict,\" said John Prendergast, a founder of the Washington-based Enough project. \"Her commitment to\naddressing root causes such as the conflict minerals that power our electronics industry was a refreshing contrast to the\nusual disaster sympathy tourism of visiting dignitaries.\"\n\"Now,\" he added, \"comes the hard part: making good on the promises and living up to the high expectations\nengendered by her visit.\"\nIn Nigeria, Mrs. Clinton pressed for electoral changes. In Liberia, she praised the country's president, Ellen Johnson\nSirleaf, the only woman in Africa to be elected head of state.\nThe Liberian visit had a special warmth, almost like a meeting of long-lost cousins. Liberia was founded in the 19th\ncentury by freed American slaves, and the country's flag, the people's names and even the police uniforms with plastic-\nbrimmed hats were all reminiscent of the American versions. Mrs. Clinton received possibly her most exuberant\nwelcome there, and a Liberian man with a long wooden horn followed her around most of the visit, blowing out loud\nfunny noises whenever she said something striking.\n\"I love that - the horn - I want to take that guy with me wherever I go,\" she said.\nIn Cape Verde, Mrs. Clinton seemed to have few bones to pick. For once, she said, she had a cheat sheet on a country\nthat included a list of far more positives than negatives. The country has fewer than 500,000 people and has escaped the\nturmoil that has engulfed so much of Africa. The all-inclusive, poolside buffet resorts here feel like something found in\nCanctIn or the Bahamas.\nMrs. Clinton called Cape Verde \"a model of democracy and economic progress in Africa.\"\nOn Friday, just as she had at every stop, she started her speech by saying, \"I bring you greetings from President Obama.\"\nShe called him a \"son of Africa\" and said that under the Obama administration, the United States was determined to\nhelp Africa reach its promise.\n###", "nbr_mention": 9, "sentiment": 0, "sentence": "a liberian man with a long wooden horn followed her around most of the visit, blowing out loud funny\nnoises whenever she said something striking"}, "Malaysia": {"mention": ["malaysia", "malaysia"], "text": "I have been monitoring the wikipedia situation and working with the R team to try and be as prepared as we can.\nI am heading to Indonesia on Monday for the opening of the new American Center and then to Malaysia where, among\nother things, I plan to work with Paul Jones on the English language initiative.\nI will be traveling all day Monday so unfortunately out of touch for about 18 hours.

Triple checking the origins.\nHillary Clinton Pledges to 'Banish Sexual Violence'\nOriginally posted Friday August 21, 2009 12:30 PM EDT\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton may be taking some well-earned R&R in Bermuda this week, but last week, the former\nFirst Lady and U.S. Senator wrapped up a grueling seven-nation diplomatic mission to Africa.\nWhile much was made back home about her snapping at a Congolese student who asked her about Bill Clinton's\nthoughts on a trade issue (\"My husband is not the secretary of state, I am,\" she retorted), the emotional heart of her\ntour was also her most dangerous stop \u2014 in Goma, inside the war zone in eastern Congo, where she tearfully met rape\nvictims on Aug. 11.In this exclusive Op-Ed piece for PEOPLE.com, Secretary Clinton shares what she learned on her visit -\nand what she will do about it.\nWhat I Saw in Goma\nBy Hillary Rodham Clinton\nIn 11 days of travel across Africa, I saw humanity at its worst \u2014 and at its best. In Goma last week, I saw both.\nThe Mugunga Internally Displaced Persons Camp sits in a land of volcanoes and great lakes on the edge of Goma, a\nprovincial capital in the eastern Congo. The camp is now home to 18,000 people seeking refuge from a cycle of violent\nconflict that has left 5.4 million dead since 1998. Chased from their homes and villages by armed rebels and informal\nmilitias, these men, women and children walked for miles with little food or water until they reached this relatively safe\nhaven.\nNow they live in tents, one next to the other, row after row, some clinging to life, others hanging on to whatever\nglimmer of hope remains in a region plagued by years of brutality. Many of these people have been robbed of their\nhomes, possessions, families and, worst of all, their dignity.\nWomen and girls in particular have been victimized on an unimaginable scale, as sexual and gender-based violence has\nbecome a tactic of war and has reached epidemic proportions. Some 1,100 rapes are reported each month, with an\naverage of 36 women and girls raped every day.\nI visited a hospital run by the organization Heal Africa and met a woman who told me that she was eight months'\npregnant when she was attacked. She was at home when a group of men broke in. They took her husband and two of\ntheir children and shot them in the front yard, before returning into the house to shoot her other two children. Then\nthey beat and gang-raped her and left her for dead. But she wasn't dead. She fought for life and her neighbors managed\nto get her to the hospital \u2014 85 kilometers away.\nI came to Goma to send a clear message: The United States condemns these attacks and all those who commit them and\nabet them. They are crimes against humanity.\nThese acts don't just harm a single individual, or a single family, or village, or group. They shred the fabric that weaves us\ntogether as human beings. Such atrocities have no place in any society. This truly is humanity at its worst.\nBut there is reason to hope. We have seen survivors summon the courage to rebuild their lives and their communities.\nWe have seen civic leaders and organizations come together to combat this appalling scourge. And we have seen health\ncare workers sacrifice comfortable careers so they can treat the wounded\nin Goma, I met doctors and advocates who work every day to repair the broken bodies and spirits of women who have\nbeen raped, often by gangs, and often in such brutal fashion that they can no longer bear children, or walk or work.\nCaregivers like Lyn Lusi, who founded Heal Africa in Goma, and Dr. Denis Mukwege, who founded the Panzi hospital in\nBukavu, represent humanity at its best.\nThe United States will stand with these brave people. This week I announced more than $17 million in new funding to\nprevent and respond to gender and sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We will provide medical care,\ncounseling, economic assistance and legal support. We will dedicate nearly $3 million to recruit and train police officers\nto protect women and girls and to investigate sexual violence. We will send technology experts to help women and\nfront-line workers report abuse using photographs and video and share information on treatment and legal options. And\nwe will deploy a team of civilian experts, medical personnel and military engineers to assess how we can further assist\nsurvivors of sexual violence.\nWhile I was in the DRC, I had very frank discussions about sexual violence with President Kabila. I stressed that the\nperpetrators of these crimes, no matter who they are, must be prosecuted and punished. This is particularly important\nwhen they are in positions of authority, including members of the Congolese military, who have been allowed to commit\nthese crimes with impunity.\nOur commitment to survivors of sexual and gender-based violence did not begin with my visit to Goma, and it will not\nend with my departure.\nWe are redoubling our efforts to address the fundamental cause of this violence: the fighting that goes on and on in the\neastern Congo. We will be taking additional steps at the United Nations and in concert with other nations to bring an\nend to this conflict.\nThere is an old Congolese proverb that says, \"No matter how long the night, the day is sure to come.\" The day must\ncome when the women of the eastern Congo can walk freely again, to tend their fields, play with their children and\ncollect firewood and water without fear. They live in a region of unrivaled natural beauty and rich resources. They are\nstrong and resilient. They could, if given the opportunity, drive economic and social progress that would make their\ncountry both peaceful and prosperous.\nWorking together, we will banish sexual violence into the dark past, where it belongs, and help the Congolese people\nseize the opportunities of a new day.", "nbr_mention": 2, "sentiment": 0, "sentence": "\nhillary clinton pledges to 'banish sexual violence'\noriginally posted friday august 21, 2009 12:30 pm edt\nsecretary of state hillary clinton may be taking some well-earned r&r in bermuda this week, but last week, the former\nfirst lady and u"}, "Namibia": {"mention": ["NAM"], "text": "Huma said you were asking about the goals and purposes of the NAM lunch Monday.", "nbr_mention": 1, "sentiment": 0, "sentence": "Huma said you were asking about the goals and purposes of the NAM lunch Monday"}, "Ecuador": {"mention": ["ecuador", "ecuador", "ecuador", "ecuador", "ecuador", "ecuador", "ecuador", "ecuador", "quito"], "text": "Abedin, Huma <AbedinH@state.gov>\nThursday, August 20, 2009 7:53 PM\nH\nFw: Russia to help Ecuador develop nuclear energy", "nbr_mention": 9, "sentiment": 0, "sentence": "gov>\nthursday, august 20, 2009 7:53 pm\nh\nfw: russia to help ecuador develop nuclear energy"}, "Jordan": {"mention": ["jordan", "jordan", "jordan", "jordan", "jordan", "jordan", "jordan", "jordan", "jordan", "jordan", "jordan", "jordan", "jordan", "jordan", "jordan", "jordan", "jordan", "jordan", "jordan", "jordan", "jordan", "jordan", "jordan"], "text": "FIRM Fogarty, Daniel .1\nSent: Tuesday, April 26, 2011 8:46 AM\nTo Mills, Cheryl D; StIlin, Jacob i Abedin, Hume; Web, Ake G\nCc S_SpeeletAardstants\nSubject: Stevens Update On Benghazi -- 4/26 7arn\nAll:\nOps has provided below the latest Stevens update on Benghazi:\n\u2022 Traffkaccidenti Police have accepted the USG version of the story: that it was an accident and the\nvictims were not wearing seathelts.

I trust that we are keeping well. I just want to use this opportunity to say that today\nwe come to the end of the program here on the President's Forum. All along this Forum and especially during the White\nHouse meeting with President Obama, I have been asking myself what it means to be here in DC and to be representing\nCameroon at this forum?\nI have recently come to the realization that the time is critical and that President Obama in his thinking about a new\nAfrica believes that young people whom we are, diverse and intelligently different can take little positive actions to\nensure that the next 50 years witnesses significant changes in our social processes, our political institutions, processes\nand structures, our economic freedom, taking into consideration our cultural specificities.\nWhile traveling to America, I kept imagining the moment when President Obama would tell us great and magical ways to\ngetting out of our current socio-economic and especially political hostage situations, but in all and after all the speeches,\nconversations and interactions with Ordinary Americans like in the Southside of Washington DC, State Department Staff,\nSenators, Secretary of State Clinton and President Obama, I noticed that America can only partner with us when we\ndecide to start thinking and acting differently in our quest for a better Cameroon and a better Africa.\nThis thinking differently is exemplified by the American Peace Corps, in the service leadership, the spirit of give back to\nthe nation and community and the transformation of challenges to opportunities in America and in many nations\naround the world...\nWhen our troubles and challenges seems gruesome and our vision blurred by the thought and fear of the unknown if we\ndared, the one thing I come out with from this Forum is this, \"That we just have to Think, Speak out and above all, DARE\ntake some innovative ACTIONs to Be the change we want to see in our communities, nations and continent and commit\nothers to same by our examples...That we have to build strong networks and undertake advocacies as a group as\nnothing has ever stopped a committed group of people to drive change aound the world.\nThe work to be done is enormous and challenging but sure the reward of every success like coming to America, to the\nWhite House and meeting with President Obama is sweet.

Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation.\nBut let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.\nIn light of the events of today, the United States government is working with partner countries\naround the world to protect our personnel, our missions, and American citizens worldwide.\nStatement on the Death of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya\nSeptember 12, 2012\nIt is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel in\nBenghazi, Libya yesterday. Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens\nand Foreign Service Information Management Officer, Sean Smith. We are still making next of\nkin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all their families and\ncolleagues.\nA 21 year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he\nsustained in the attack on our office in Benghazi.\nI had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke\neloquently about his passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This\nassignment was only the latest in his more than two decades of dedication to advancing closer\nties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a Peace Corps\nVolunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans\non the ground in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to\nbuild the foundation for a new, free nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work\nthat he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's values and interests, even when\nthat meant putting himself in danger.\nSean Smith was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten years ago.

Prior to arriving in Benghazi, he served in Baghdad, Pretoria,\nMontreal, and most recently The Hague.\nAll the Americans we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this\nvicious and violent attack that took their lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan\npeople reach for a better future.\nAmerica's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country.\nWe are honored by the service of each and every one of them.\nRemarks on the Deaths of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya\nSeptember 12, 2012\nYesterday, our U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya was attacked. Heavily armed militants\nassaulted the compound and set fire to our buildings. American and Libyan security personnel\nbattled the attackers together. Four Americans were killed. They included Sean Smith, a Foreign\nService information management officer, and our Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. We are\nstill making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals.\nThis is an attack that should shock the conscience of people of all faiths around the world. We\ncondemn in the strongest terms this senseless act of violence, and we send our prayers to the\nfamilies, friends, and colleagues of those we've lost.\nAll over the world, every day, America's diplomats and development experts risk their lives in\nthe service of our country and our values, because they believe that the United States must be a\nforce for peace and progress in the world, that these aspirations are worth striving and sacrificing\nfor. Alongside our men and women in uniform, they represent the best traditions of a bold and\ngenerous nation.\nIn the lobby of this building, the State Department, the names of those who have fallen in the line\nof duty are inscribed in marble. Our hearts break over each one. And now, because of this\ntragedy, we have new heroes to honor and more friends to mourn.\nChris Stevens fell in love with the Middle East as a young Peace Corps volunteer teaching\nEnglish in Morocco. He joined the Foreign Service, learned languages, won friends for America\nin distant places, and made other people's hopes his own.\nIn the early days of the Libyan revolution, I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition.\nHe arrived on a cargo ship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships with\nLibya's revolutionaries. He risked his life to stop a tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a\nbetter Libya. The world needs more Chris Stevenses. I spoke with his sister, Ann, this morning,\nand told her that he will be remembered as a hero by many nations.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

He spent 10 years as an information management officer\nin the State Department, he was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary\nassignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather, with whom I spoke this morning. He was a\nfather to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being proud of the\nservice their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and\nfinally to Benghazi.\nThe mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary,\nand we and the people of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy.\nToday, many Americans are asking \u2014 indeed, I asked myself\u2014 how could this happen? How\ncould this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from destruction?\nThis question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be.\nBut we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group \u2014\nnot the people or Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a\ncountry scarred by war and tyranny, they were hailed as friends and partners. And when the\nattack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post. Some were wounded.\nLibyans carried Chris' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to\nsafety. And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the\nviolence and pledged every effort to protect our people and pursue those responsible.\nThe friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty\nof this attack. A free and stable Libya is still in America's interest and security, and we will not\nturn our back on that, nor will we rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and\nbrought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities to move swiftly and\nsurely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American\nembassies, consulates, and citizens.\nThere will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher\npriority than protecting our men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine\nthe precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault. Some have sought to\njustify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our Embassy in Cairo\nyesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the intemet. America's commitment\nto religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear \u2014 there is\nno justification for this, none. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long\nas there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a\ntrue and lasting peace.\nIt is especially difficult that this happened on September I I th. It's an anniversary that means a\ngreat deal to all Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet\nfinished, that the job of putting an end to violent extremism and building a safe and stable world\ncontinues. But September 11th means even more than that. It is a day on which we remember\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Doherty in Benghazi, Libya\nSeptember 13, 2012\nThe attack on our diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya on Tuesday claimed the lives of four\nAmericans. Yesterday, I spoke about two: Ambassador Chris Stevens and Information\nManagement Officer Sean Smith. Today, we also recognize the two security personnel who died\nhelping protect their colleagues. Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty were both decorated\nmilitary veterans who served our country with honor and distinction. Our thoughts, prayers, and\ndeepest gratitude are with their families and friends. Our embassies could not carry on our\ncritical work around the world without the service and sacrifice of brave people like Tyrone and\nGlen.\nTyrone's friends and colleagues called him \"Rone,\" and they relied on his courage and skill,\nhoned over two decades as a Navy SEAL. In uniform, he served multiple tours in Iraq and\nAfghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in dangerous posts from\nCentral America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well as the arm of a warrior,\nearning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. All our hearts go out to\nTyrone's wife Dorothy and his three sons, Tyrone Jr., Hunter, and Kai, who was born just a few\nmonths ago.\nWe also grieve for Glen Doherty, called Bub, and his family: his father Bernard, his mother\nBarbara, his brother Gregory, and his sister Kathleen. Glen was also a former Navy SEAL and an\nexperienced paramedic. And he put his life on the line many times, protecting Americans in Iraq,\nAfghanistan, and other hotspots. In the end, he died the way he lived \u2014 with selfless honor and\nunstinting valor.\nWe condemn the attack that took the lives of these heroes in the strongest terms, and we are\ntaking additional steps to safeguard American embassies, consulates, and citizens around the\nworld. This violence should shock the conscience of people of all faiths and traditions. We\nappreciate the statements of support that have poured in from across the region and beyond.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Well, let me welcome our friends and colleagues\nfrom Morocco here to the Benjamin Franklin Room on the eighth floor of the State Department\nfor this very important first session of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue. Before I begin to\naddress the significance of this Strategic Dialogue and the next step in our long relations with\nMorocco, I want to say a few words about the events unfolding in the world today.\nWe are closely watching what is happening in Yemen and elsewhere, and we certainly hope and\nexpect that there will be steps taken to avoid violence and prevent the escalation of protests into\nviolence.\nI also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to these\nprotests in a number of countries. Let me state very clearly \u2014 and I hope it is obvious \u2014 that the\nUnited States Government had absolutely nothing to do with this video. We absolutely reject its\ncontent and message. America's commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very\nbeginning of our nation. And as you know, we are home to people of all religions, many of\nwhom came to this country seeking the right to exercise their own religion, including, of course,\nmillions of Muslims. And we have the greatest respect for people of faith.\nTo us, to me personally, this video is disgusting and reprehensible. It appears to have a deeply\ncynical purpose: to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage. But as I said yesterday, there\nis no justification, none at all, for responding to this video with violence, We condemn the\nviolence that has resulted in the strongest terms, and we greatly appreciate that many Muslims in\nthe United States and around the world have spoken out on this issue.\nViolence, we believe, has no place in religion and is no way to honor religion. Islam, like other\nreligions, respects the fundamental dignity of human beings, and it is a violation of that\nfundamental dignity to wage attacks on innocents. As long as there are those who are willing to\nshed blood and take innocent life in the name of religion, the name of God, the world will never\nknow a true and lasting peace. It is especially wrong for violence to be directed against\ndiplomatic missions. These are places whose very purpose is peaceful: to promote better\nunderstuiding across countries and cultures.

Now, I would\nnote that in today's world with today's technologies, that is impossible. But even if it were\npossible, our country does have a long tradition of free expression which is enshrined in our\nConstitution and our law, and we do not stop individual citizens from expressing their views no\nmatter how distasteful they may be.\nThere are, of course, different views around the world about the outer limits of free speech and\nfree expression, but there should be no debate about the simple proposition that violence in\nresponse to speech is not acceptable. We all \u2014 whether we are leaders in government, leaders in\ncivil society or religious leaders \u2014 must draw the line at violence. And any responsible leader\nshould be standing up now and drawing that line.\nI wanted to begin with this statement, because, as our Moroccan friends and all of you know, this\nhas been a difficult week at the State Department. I very much appreciate, Minister, the\ncondolences your government expressed to our Embassy in Rabat And even though that tragedy\nhappened far away in Benghazi, we found a reminder of the deep bounds that connect Morocco\nto the United States. It was in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco that one of the Americans\nwe lost this week, Ambassador Chris Stevens, fell in love with the region when he served as a\nPeace Corps volunteer there. That experience set him on a decades-long career of service. So in\nthe memory of fallen friends and colleagues, let us remind ourselves of the many ways in which\nriot just our governments but the people of our two nations have worked together to build a better\nfuture.\nIn many ways, the United States looks to Morocco to be a leader and a model. His Majesty King\nMohammed deserves great credit for the work you've undertaken. In fact, after my visit to Rabat\nearlier this year. I told my team: \"We need to start a Strategic Dialogue with Morocco.\" No\ncountry has been a friend of the United States longer than Morocco. You were the first nation to\nrecognize us back in 1777. But we're not satisfied with simply having a friendship that is\nlongstanding We want one that is dynamic, growing, looking toward the future. So let me\nhighlight a few of the areas we should focus on today.\nOn political reform, we have all seen remarkable changes taking place across North Africa and\nthe Middle East. I commend Morocco and your government for your efforts to stay ahead of\nthese changes by holding free and fair elections, empowering the elected parliament, taking other\nsteps to ensure that the government reflects the will of the people. Today, our political working\ngroup will discuss how the United States can continue to support your efforts to translate\ncommitments into actions. Because as we all know, democracy, real reform, require that people\nthemselves feel the changes in their evetyday lives: the courts reformed, the government more\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

We know that child brides are less likely to get an education, more likely to face\nlife-threatening problems, particularly around child birth and delivery, which not only\nshortchanges them but can even rob them and their communities of their lives and talents. So we\nwant to encourage the government and civil society to continue their important work together on\nthis issue.\nWith regard to the Western Sahara, the United States continues to support efforts to find a\npeaceful, sustainable, mutually agreed-upon solution. U.S. policy toward the Western Sahara has\nremained consistent for many years. We have made clear that Morocco's autonomy plan is\nserious, realistic, and credible, and that it represents a potential approach that could satisfy the\naspirations of the people in the Western Sahara to run their own affairs in peace and dignity. We\ncontinue to support the negotiations carried out by the United Nations and hope parties can work\ntoward resolution.\nWith respect to the economy, our second working group will focus on what more can be done to\ndeliver tangible economic benefits. Morocco's economy is relatively healthy, but you face the\nsame problem that is now endemic across the world \u2014 unemployment is still too high, especially\namong young people.\nThat's why the United States is providing $1.5 million to support an effort to attract foreign\ninvestors, foster local economic development, and combat corruption across the region. And I'm\npleased to announce that later this year we will hold a Morocco business development\nconference here in Washington to connect businesses from both countries.\nToday, we should discuss ways to build on all of these efforts by increasing bilateral trade, a\nparticular goal of mine since so much trade from Morocco goes to Europe. I'd like to increase\nthe amount of trade coming to the United States, and also to improve economic integration\nacross North Africa, which could greatly benefit Morocco because of Morocco's stability and\nMorocco's very strong economic foundation. The greater integration there is, the greater the\nbenefits for Moroccans.\nThird, the attack in Benghazi this week reminds us that security remains a vital issue. Through\nour work together on the Global Counterterrorism Task Force, the United States and Morocco\nalready share crucial information and best practices, and I thank Morocco for hosting a Global\nCounterterrorism Task Force workshop on threats in the South Atlantic next month.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

And so we are\npartnering to help strengthen Morocco's criminal justice system and law enforcement.\nThere will be a lot to discuss in the meeting today. And let me add, the United States greatly\nappreciates the constructive role Morocco is playing on the UN Security Council, especially your\nsupport for the effort to end the violence and bloodshed in Syria and help to usher in a new\ndemocratic future for that country. I commend Morocco for offering to host the next ministerial\nmeeting of the Friends of the Syrian People, and we look forward to continuing to work closely\ntogether as close partners even after your term on the Security Council has ended.\nFinally, our education and cultural ties are reason for much celebration. This year marks the 30th\nanniversary of our official program to facilitate academic exchanges and other bonds between us.\nThere are more than 5,000 Moroccan alumni of these programs. Two are with us today \u2014 Dr.\nBenjelloun and Dr. Ouaouicha \u2014 and we thank them. But among all our work on this front, from\npreserving Morocco's historic sites to empowering youth, there's one area I particularly hope we\ncan focus on today and receive your advice and counsel \u2014 namely, interfaith dialogue.\nIn these tense and turbulent times, it's more important than ever for people of different faiths to\nexchange ideas, to build understanding, to promote religious tolerance. It's one of the great\nchallenges of the 21st century, and it's one that we must address together.\nSo we have a lot of work to do, Minister, but our friendship runs long and deep, and as the treaty\nour nations signed in 1786 says, and I quote, \"Trusting in God, it will remain permanent.\" I'm\nconfident that we will continue to solve problems and produce results that make our nations\nstronger, more peaceful, more secure, more prosperous, and also contribute to doing the same for\nthe world.\nSo again, let me welcome you, Minister. It's been a great pleasure for me to get to know you, to\nwork with you, to be your colleague bilaterally, regionally, and globally, and also welcome your\ndistinguished delegation.\nThank you.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nTonight, our gathering is more somber than any of us would like. This comes during sad and\ndifficult days for the State Department family. We lost four Americans. They were good and\nbrave men. They were committed to the cause of building a brighter future for the people of\nLibya. And we condemn the violence in the strongest terms, the violence against our posts in\nBenghazi, in Egypt, and now in Yemen.\nThe Libyan ambassador is with us tonight, and I want to take a moment to thank him for the\nsupport that his government and the Libyan people have shown to the United States in this\ntragedy, particularly the outpouring of feelings of grief and loss because of the killing of our\nambassador.\nAmbassador Aujali, would you mind saying a few words?\nAMBASSADOR AMU: [redacted]\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Ambassador. I know that that was a very\npersonal loss for you, as it was for me. I'm the one who sent Chris to Benghazi during the\nrevolution to show support and be able to advise our government about what we could do to\nbring freedom and democracy and opportunity to the people of Libya.\nReligious freedom and religious tolerance are essential to the stability of any nation, any people.\nHatred and violence in the name of religion only poison the well. All people of faith and good\nwill know that the actions of a small and savage group in Benghazi do not honor religion or God\nin any way. Nor do they speak for the more than one billion Muslims around the world, many of\nwhom have shown an outpouring of support during this time\nUnfortunately, however, over the last 24 hours, we have also seen violence spread elsewhere.\nSome seek to justify this behavior as a response to inflammatory, despicable material posted on\nthe intemet. As I said earlier today, the United States rejects both the content and the message of\nthat video. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of\nothers. At our meeting earlier today, my colleague, the foreign minister of Morocco, said that all\nprophets should be respected because they are all symbols of our humanity, for all humanity.\nBut both of us were crystal clear in this paramount message: There is never any justification for\nviolent acts of this kind. And we look to leaders around the world to stand up and speak out\nagainst violence, and to take steps to protect diplomatic missions from attack.\nThink about it. When Christians are subject to insults to their faith, and that certainly happens,\nwe expect them not to resort to violence. When Hindus or Buddhists are subjected to insults to\ntheir faiths, and that also certainly happens, we expect them not to resort to violence. The same\ngoes for all faiths, including Islam.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nWhen all of us who are people of faith - and I am one \u2014 feel the pain of insults, of\nmisunderstanding, of denigration to what we cherish, we must expect ourselves and others not to\nresort to violence, That is a universal standard and expectation, and it is everyone's obligation to\nmeet that, so that we make no differences, we expect no less of ourselves than we expect of\nothers, You cannot respond to offensive speech with violence without begetting more violence.\nAnd I so strongly believe that the great religions of the world are stronger than any insults. They\nhave withstood offense for centuries. Refraining from violence, then, is not a sign of weakness in\none's faith; it is absolutely the opposite, a sign that one's faith is unshakable.\nSo tonight, we must come together and recommit ourselves to working toward a future marked\nby understanding and acceptance rather than distrust, hatred, and fear. We can pledge that\nwhenever one person speaks out in ignorance and bigotry, ten voices will answer. They will\nanswer resoundingly against the offense and the insult, answering ignorance with enlightenment,\nanswering hatred with understanding, answering darkness with light; that if one person commits\na violent act in the name of religion, millions will stand up and condemn it out of strength.\nIn times like these, it can be easy to despair that some differences are irreconcilable, some\nmountains too steep to climb; we will therefore never reach the level of understanding and\npeacefulness that we seek, and which I believe the great religions of the world call us to pursue.\nBut that's not what I believe, and I don't think it's what you believe either here tonight. Part of\nwhat makes our country so special is we keep trying. We keep working. We keep investing in\nour future. We keep supporting the next generation, believing that young people can keep us\nmoving forward in a positive direction.\nSo tonight I think it's important that we talk not just about that better tomorrow that we all seek,\nbut also about some of the things \u2014 the real, practical, tangible things \u2014 that young people are\ndoing to help shape that better future.\nTwo years ago in this room, at our Eid reception, we launched a program called Generation\nChange to lead a grassroots agenda of positive engagement with Muslim communities. And I\nasked the young Muslim leaders in the audience that night to be our unofficial ambassadors, to\nhelp build personal connections, seek out partners in other countries. And I can report to you\ntonight they did not disappoint. In a few minutes, you're going to meet some of these young\nleaders, each with a powerful story to tell.\nThe Generation Change network that started in this room now circles the globe. We are building\nan international alliance of young people who want to drive change in their own communities.\nThey act as mentors, spark respectful debates, simply offer words of encouragement when\nneeded. But most importantly, they inspire others to keep expanding the circle of mutual\nunderstanding and respect, one person at a time.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Our 2012 Hours Against Hate initiative encourages\nyoung people to put themselves in another person's shoes through service projects. So far, young\npeople from all over the world have pledged thousands of volunteer hours to help people from a\ndifferent background, to see them as a fellow human being, not a stereotype, not a caricature, but\nanother real live person \u2014 people who don't look like you, live like you, pray like you, but with\nwhom we will share this planet. And therefore, we have work to do.\nPeople of faith and conscience are called to be the leaders of tolerance. In my tradition, like all\ntraditions, we are expected to love one another. And together, we have to translate that into better\nunderstanding and cooperation. I'm particularly pleased that the young people you will hear from\ntonight are really setting an example, not only for young people elsewhere in the world but,\nfrankly, for us who are older as well.\nLet me now call to the stage someone who has been a tremendous assistance to me in these\nefforts. Farah Pandith is the Department's first Special Representative to Muslim Communities.\nAnd from the beginning, she has made reaching out to young people and civil society her top\npriority. Farah will introduce you to three young leaders who I am very proud of\nRemarks at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony to Honor Those Lost in Attacks in Benghazi, Libya\nSeptember 14, 2012\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Chaplain.

To the families of our fallen colleagues, I offer our most heartfelt condolences and\ndeepest gratitude.\nSean Smith joined the State Department after six years in the Air Force. He was respected as an\nexpert on technology by colleagues in Pretoria, Baghdad, Montreal, and The Hague. He enrolled\nin correspondence courses at Penn State and had high hopes for the future. Sean leaves behind a\nloving wife Heather, two young children, Samantha and Nathan, and scores of grieving family,\nfriends, and colleagues. And that's just in this world. Because online in the virtual worlds that\nSean helped create, he is also being mourned by countless competitors, collaborators, and garners\nwho shared his passion.\nTyrone Woods, known to most as Rone, spent two decades as a Navy SEAL, serving multiple\ntours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in\ndangerous posts from Central America to the Middle East.

Our thoughts and prayers are with Glen's father Bernard, his\nmother Barbara, his brother Gregory, his sister Kathleen, and their grieving families, friends, and\ncolleagues.\nI was honored to know Ambassador Chris Stevens. I want to thank his parents and siblings, who\nare here today, for sharing Chris with us and with our country. What a wonderful gift you gave\nus. Over his distinguished career in the Foreign Service, Chris won friends for the United States\nin far-flung places. He made those people's hopes his own. During the revolution in Libya, he\nrisked his life to help protect the Libyan people from a tyrant, and he gave his life helping them\nbuild a better country.\nPeople loved to work with Chris. And as he rose through the ranks, they loved to work for Chris.\nHe was known not only for his courage but for his smile \u2014 goofy but contagious \u2014 for his sense\nof fun and that California cool.\nIn the days since the attack, so many Libyans \u2014 including the Ambassador from Libya to the\nUnited States, who is with us today \u2014 have expressed their sorrow and solidarity. One young\nwoman, her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness, held up a handwritten sign that said\n\"Thugs and killers don't represent Benghazi nor Islam,\" The President of the Palestinian\nAuthority, who worked closely with Chris when he served in Jerusalem, sent me a letter\nremembering his energy and integrity, and deploring \u2014 and I quote \u2014 \"an act of ugly terror.\"\nMany others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments.\nThis has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We've seen the\nheavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We've seen rage\nand violence directed at American embassies over an awful interne video that we had nothing to\ndo with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because it is senseless, and it is\ntotally unacceptable.\nThe people of Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the\ntyranny of a mob. Reasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do\neverything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts. And\nwe will, under the President's leadership, keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the\nworld.\nThere will be more difficult days ahead, but it is important that we don't lose sight of the\nfundamental fact that America must keep leading the world. We owe it to those four men to\ncontinue the long, hard work of diplomacy. I am enormously proud of the men and women of the\nState Department.

The President of the United States.\nRemarks With Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Patricia Espinosa After Their\nMeeting\nSeptember 18, 2012\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it is such a pleasure for me to\nwelcome my friend and colleague, Secretary Espinosa, along with a very distinguished\ndelegation of officials from the Mexican Government for this continuation of consultation at the\nhighest levels of each of our governments.\nBefore I turn to the matters discussed today, let me give a brief update on the ongoing U.S.\nresponse to the protests in the Middle East and elsewhere. I'm sure as you know already, we are\ntaking aggressive steps to protect our staffs in embassies and consulates worldwide. That\nincludes reviewing our security posture at every post and augmenting it where necessary. And\nwe are working closely with the Libyan Government in our efforts to bring to justice those who\nmurdered our four American colleagues in Benghazi.\nThe FBI is now in Tripoli to join the investigation with Libyan officials, and there is nothing\nmore important to us than ensuring the safety of our American representatives worldwide. At the\nsame time, as I have said to State Department employees, the incidents of the past week highlight\nhow important our work is. The United States must and will remain strongly engaged in the\nworld. Our men and women risk their lives in service to our country and our values, because they\nknow that the United States must be a force for peace and progress. That is worth striving and\nsacrificing for, and nothing that happened last week changes this fundamental fact.\nNow, turning to our friends and partners in Mexico, we are always pleased to have a chance to\ndiscuss matters of mutual interest and concern between us. Mexico is one of our closest friends\nas well as partner on dozens of critical issues. So we talk about every kind of issue you can\nimagine, from education and healthcare to poverty alleviation to the environment.

And I want to offer\nmy personal appreciation to President Calderon and to Foreign Secretary Espinosa for their\nleadership and commitment to this partnership and to all on both sides of the border in our\ngovernments who have been deeply engaged and committed to it. The Merida Initiative\nrepresents an unprecedented level of security cooperation between Mexico and the United States.\nAs our countries continue to deal with the serious challenge of transnational criminal\norganizations, including drug traffickers, illegal arms traffickers, money launderers, and violent\ngangs that threaten people on both sides of the border, we well know there is no quick and easy\nway to stop these criminals and bring them to justice. But nevertheless, during the past now\nnearly four years, our countries have collaborated to an extraordinary and unprecedented degree.\nWe have brought together policy makers and experts from across our governments and societies\nwho have worked hand in hand to keep our people safe. And I think the habits of cooperation we\nhave built are among our most important achievements, and we will rely on them for a long time\nto come.\nToday, our delegations reviewed the gains we've made on key priorities, including improving\nlaw enforcement coordination, reducing the demand for drugs, modernizing our border\ninfrastructure, strengthening the rule of law, and building more resilient and empowered\ncommunities. We also discussed the lessons we've learned and the work that lies ahead in these\nand other areas, which our joint statement will reflect. I want to underscore how important our\nsecurity relationship with Mexico is to the United States.\nThe Government of Mexico and the Mexican people have faced the threat posed by these\ncriminals with courage and resolve, and we remain committed to doing everything we can to\nsupport Mexico as it continues to work to bring those criminals to justice. This is a transnational\nproblem, and it calls for a transnational solution, and the United States believes this is a matter of\nshared responsibility. That was the first message I brought as Secretary of State when I came to\nMexico, and it continues to be the hallmark of our efforts together. Making sure our people are\nsafe and our neighbors are safe is of the utmost importance to us.\nNow, our two countries share many other priorities, and one of them, empowering women and\ngirls, was also addressed today. We took the opportunity, the Foreign Secretary and I, to sign a\nMemorandum of Understanding between our countries to work together to advance gender\nequality, empower girls and women, promote their human rights, and enhance their security.\nSo again, Secretary Espinosa, let me thank you for years of work and effort, for our productive\nconversations in many places around the world and again today, and for being such a valuable\ncolleague and partner. The United States deeply, deeply values our relationship with Mexico and\nthe ties of family and friendship that connect so many millions of our people.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

We believe strongly that presidential administrations may\nchange, elections will come and go, but we have established a firm foundation for cooperation\nthat has already benefited both our countries and which will continue to benefit both of our\ncountries for many years ahead. So thank you very much.\nMS. NULAND: We'll take (inaudible). Margaret Brennan, CBS News.\nQUESTION: Madam Secretary, thanks for your time. Are you any closer to finding who killed\nAmbassador Chris Stevens?, Libya's President says this attack was planned for months. Are you\nconfident he's wrong and that security measures were appropriate? And will you leave justice to\nthe Libyans?\nSECRETARY CLINTON: As I said at the outset, we are taking aggressive steps to protect our\npeople and our consulates and embassies around the world. We are reviewing our security\nposture at every post and working with host governments to be sure they know what our security-\nneeds are wherever necessary. We are also working closely with the Libyan Government to bring\nthe perpetrators to justice so that we can be assured that we have found who murdered our four,\ncolleagues and under what circumstances. As I said, the FBI has joined the investigation inside\nLibya, and we will not rest until the people who orchestrated this attack are found and punished.\nIt is also important to look at this strategically and understand what is going on across the region.\nIn a number of places where protests have tuned violent, we are seeing the hand of extremists\nwho are trying to exploit people's inflamed passions for their own agendas. But overwhelmingly,\nwe have found that the people of Egypt, of Libya, of Yemen and Tunisia are not prepared to\ntrade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob. They want to turn their attention to the\nfuture to provide better opportunities for themselves and their children, and they want a strong\npartnership with the United States and the American people based on mutual interests and mutual\nrespect.\nThis is part of a larger debate that is going on inside these societies. In Libya, for example, in\ntheir first free elections, moderates were successful at the polls. But look, there are extremists in\nall of these societies and on the outside who are working to take advantage of broad outrage in\norder to incite violence and specifically incite violence against Americans and American\nfacilities.\nAnd as I have said to many of the leaders I have spoken to over the past week, these extremist\nefforts are a threat to the people of the societies and the governments of those societies as well as\nto the region and the United States. And I think it's important at this moment for leaders to put\nthemselves on the right side of this debate - to speak out clearly and unequivocally against\nviolence, whoever incites it or conducts it\nAnd in a struggle like this, there can be no doubt where the United States must stand. We support\nthose who are fighting for the same values and rights that we believe in - in democracy, in\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

And I want to\nunderscore that the United States will continue to work with partners and allies in the region and\naround the world to help bring security to these nations so that the promise of the revolutions that\nthey experienced can be realized.\nAnd finally, on your specific point about Benghazi, we obviously never talk publicly about\nsecurity at any of our missions for obvious reasons. But that said, let me assure you that our\nsecurity in Benghazi included a unit of host government security forces, as well as a local guard\nforce of the kind that we rely on in many places around the world. In addition to the security\noutside the compound, we relied on a wall and a robust security presence inside the compound.\nAnd with all of our missions overseas, in advance of September lid', as is done every year, we\ndid an evaluation on threat streams. And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has\nsaid we had no actionable intelligence that an attack on our post in Benghazi was planned or\nimminent.\nBut let me state the obvious again. Our diplomats engage in dangerous work, and it's the nature\nof diplomacy in fragile societies and conflict zones to be aware of the necessity for security but\nto also continue the important diplomatic work that has to go on. There is risk inherent in what\nwe do and what these brave men and women representing the United States are up against every\nsingle day, and we do our very best to limit that risk by ensuring that our security protocols\nreflect the environments in which diplomats work and the threats that they are presented with.\nThank you.\nRemarks With Indonesian Foreign Minister Raden Mohammad Marty Muliana\nNatalegawa After Their Meeting\nSeptember 20, 2012\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it's such a pleasure, as always, to\nwelcome the Indonesian Foreign Minister, and I believe the largest delegation that has ever come\nfrom Indonesia, for the purpose of our third meeting of the U.S.-Indonesia Joint Commission.\nThis commission is the result of a vision by our two presidents for a comprehensive partnership,\nand the agreement to that effect was signed in 2010. Thanks to this partnership, the United States\nand Indonesia are working more closely than ever on a range of issues from global security to\nclean energy and climate to regional trade and commerce.\nAnd today, Marty and I had the chance to take stock of where our teams have come in the time\nof the last year, because we liad our meeting in Bali a year ago. And I must say, I was very\nimpressed. We covered a great deal today.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nBut before I start, I'd like to say a few words about the protests in several countries around the\nworld. We have condemned in the strongest possible terms the violence that has erupted from\nthese protests. And as I have said, the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and\nreprehensible, and the United States Government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it.\nBut there is no justification for violence, and I want to thank the Foreign Minister and his\ngovernment for speaking out against violence. We have to look to reasonable people and\nresponsible leaders everywhere to stand up to extremists who would seek to take advantage of\nthis moment to commit violent acts against embassies and their fellow countrymen.\nToday's meetings have highlighted the strong foundation that we have built together. And one of\nour most important concerns is promoting peace and stability in the Asia Pacific. Today, I'm\nannouncing that the Obama Administration has informed Congress of the potential sale of eight\nAH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters to the Indonesian Government. This agreement will\nstrengthen our comprehensive partnership and help enhance security across the region.\nOn growth and prosperity, we are increasing our trade relationship that topped $26 billion last\nyear. Investments in transportation, energy, and infrastructure are creating jobs and supporting\neconomic growth in both countries. For example, the deal between Lion Air and Boeing alone\nrepresents $21 billion in trade over the next decade. Indonesia's Government has announced half\na trillion dollars in infrastructure improvements, and we recently signed a memorandum of\nunderstanding to make it easier for American companies to bid on these projects.\nAnd yesterday, we signed an agreement for implementing our Millennium Challenge\nCorporation Compact with Indonesia. Over the next five years, the United States will invest $600\nmillion in clean energy development, child health and nutrition programs, and efforts to help\nmake Indonesia's Government more transparent and open.\nThe United States is also looking forward to Indonesia hosting APEC in 2013, and we are\nconfident that Indonesia will come to this role with a commitment to promote greater economic\nintegration across the Asia Pacific.\nBoth the Foreign Minister and I believe that strong education is essential to compete in a modem\nglobal economy. That's why the United States has expanded the Fulbright Program and\nsupported partnerships between dozens of American and Indonesian universities. Academic\nexchanges between our countries are up and applications from Indonesian students to visit the\nUnited States have increased by one third. USAID has recently expanded its basic education\nprogram to provide $83 million for teacher training and literacy programs for young children.\nAnd we're providing $20 in scholarship funding for Indonesian graduate students.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

The Foreign Minister's\npersonal leadership has helped lay the groundwork for diplomacy between ASEAN and China as\nit relates to the South China Sea. And we continue to support ASEAN's six-point principles,\nwhich we believe will help reduce tensions and pave the way for a comprehensive code of\nconduct for addressing disputes without threats, coercion, or use of force.\nFinally. Indonesia and the United States have stood together on a range of global challenges,\nfrom democratic reform in Burma to combating climate change, to working to end the violence\nin Syria. We are also coordinating efforts to further develop south-south and triangular\ncooperation, such as enhancing disaster preparedness in Burma and convening a conference on\nwomen's empowerment.\nWe believe that as the second and third-largest democracies in the world, the United States and\nIndonesia have a special responsibility to promote democracy and human rights. And for the last\nfour years, Indonesia has hosted the Bali Democracy Forum to promote peaceful, democratic\ntransitions through example and open dialogue. Last year, more than 80 countries attended. And\nonce again, the United States will be sending a high-level delegation.\nSo, Minister, thank you for everything. Thank you for the great partnership we've had between\nus and between our countries.\nMS. NULAND: We'll take two questions today, we'll start with Ros Jordan of Al Jazeera\nEnglish.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Madam Secretary, Mr. Foreign Minister. Madam Secretary, my\nquestion is about the ongoing investigation into last week's attack at the consulate in Benghazi.\nYou are meeting this afternoon with members of Congress to discuss the progress and the\nconcerns that they understandably have. First, there is the federal mandate to establish an\naccountability review board. Have you done so? Who would you like to see chair it? Are there\ncertain questions that you desperately want to have answered in order to safeguard the safety of\nForeign Service Officers around the world?\nAnd related to this, given the political instability and the successes of the past year and a half, are\nyou satisfied that in light of those political changes, enough was done to protect those working in\nthe Middle East and North Africa? And then finally \u2014 and this is perhaps going into the area of\nrumor and speculation \u2014 but there is at least one report suggesting that Ambassador Stevens felt\nthat he was on a, quote, \"al-Qaida hit list\" Is this a scurrilous rumor? Is this gallows humor\nwhen one is working in a period of difficulty and great challenge, or is there something more to\nwhat he allegedly \u2014 and I stress that word \u2014 said?\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Well, first, let me say I'm looking forward to the opportunity to go\nup to the Congress today. I will be briefing in two separate sessions, the House and the Senate, in\na classified setting, along with my interagency colleagues, as we continue to work together, and\nwith governments around the world, to ensure that our people and our facilities are safe. I will be\njoined today by the Director of National Intelligence, General Clapper, by the Deputy Secretary\nof Defense, Ash Carter, by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Sandy Winnefeld,\nalong with experts from the FBI, the State Department, and elsewhere in the government.\nNow, I anticipate that this briefing will cover our security posture before and during the events,\nand the steps we have taken since to do everything we can with host governments to protect our\npeople and our embassies and consulates. The Director of National Intelligence will speak to the\nintelligence issues surrounding these events in Libya. Deputy Secretary Carter will brief on the\nsuperb support we have had from the U.S. military in the wake of these events, and we are at the\nvery early stages of an FBI investigation. The team from the FBI reached Libya earlier this week.\nAnd I will advise Congress also that I am launching an accountability review board that will be\nchaired by Ambassador Thomas Pickering.\nI will also talk about the importance of the broader relationships with these countries in light of\nthe events of the past days. There are obviously very real challenges in these new democracies,\nthese fragile societies, but as I said last week, the vast majority of the people in these countries\ndid not throw off the tyranny of a dictator to trade it for the tyranny of a mob. And we are\nconcerned first and foremost with our own people and facilities, but we are concerned about the\ninternal security in these countries because ultimately, that puts at risk the men, women, and\nchildren of these societies on a daily ongoing basis if actions are not taken to try to restore\nsecurity and civil order.\nAnd let me just conclude by saying that there can be no doubt where the United States stands.\nWe continue to support those who are fighting for universal values \u2014 values that we see at work\nin Indonesia \u2014 the third largest democracy in the world. We believe that these values of universal\nrights, of justice and accountability, of democracy, are there for every person regardless of where\nthat person might live. So I will look forward to having a chance to talk with members of\nCongress.\nAs to your final question, I have absolutely no information or reason to believe that there's any\nbasis for that.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMS. NULAND: Last question. Victoria Sidjabat from Tempo Magazine, please.\nQUESTION: Yes. Madam, thank you.

If it's continuing happen, it's \u2014\nobviously could give impact to the implementation of (inaudible) program in Indonesia. What is\nthe reason U.S. Government closed the Embassy and Consulate in Indonesia? What is your\nexpectation from Indonesia Government, for my Minister Marty Natalegawa? How Indonesia\nGovernment respond to the closing of this Embassy and Consulate, it's starting today? Is U.S. \u2014\nIndonesia Government has capability to protect U.S. Embassy and Consulate. So the (inaudible)\nprogram implemented \u2014 could be implemented successfully in Indonesia. Thank you.\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Well, let me begin by saying how grateful we are for the excellent\ncooperation we have received from the Government of Indonesia, and in particular, from the law\nenforcement and security institutions in Indonesia. We are very grateful for not only the\ncooperation and protection that has been provided to our facilities, but also to the strong\nstatements condemning violence from the President, the Foreign Mihister, and others.\nIn consultation with the Government of Indonesia, we have temporarily, for tomorrow, closed\nour facilities. We want to be sure that law enforcement in Indonesia has the ability to do what it\nneeds to do to make sure that there is no disruption of civil order and security. So we are\ncooperating completely, and we're very grateful for the strong leadership provided by Indonesia.\nFOREIGN MINISTER NATALEGAWA: Hello, (inaudible), if I may just also respond.\nPrecisely as the Secretary had said, the decision by the United States Government to close\ntemporarily its embassies and consulates tomorrow in Indonesia is a decision that's been made\nbased on communication and conversation between the authorities in Indonesia and the United\nStates as well. So in other words, it is an informed decision, a decision that is not intended to\nshow any unfriendly intent on the part of anyone, but it is what it is, and it's quite some \u2014 it's the\nkind of step that governments actually carry out when situations requires it, even in our case.\nSome of our embassies abroad, when the situation requires us to have a temporary closing of the\nembassy, we do that as well. So it is something that is quite regular and something that is\nactually coordinated as well.\nBut if I may just broaden the subject matter, I think as our President had said in the past,\nIndonesian Government the Indonesian people, even, obviously cannot and would not condone\nthe \u2014 any acts of violence against diplomatic premises, against diplomatic personnel, because\nthat is, truly \u2014 would be a challenge to the efficient and a proper conduct of relations among\nstates. So that's our point of departure.\nAt the same time, of course, beyond the immediate issue of protection of the embassies, we have\nstill ahead of us the challenge of how to prevent the kind of situations where we are now at in\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

We've had the opportunity to meet in Islamabad and other\nsettings, but I am very pleased that we would have this chance to exchange views on our bilateral\nrelationship as well as regional and global issues.\nI want to begin by addressing the events of the day and the past week. Today, we've once again\nseen protests in several cities in Pakistan. Unfortunately, some of those protests have turned\nviolent and, sadly, resulted in loss of life. I want to thank the Government of Pakistan for their\nefforts to protect our Embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Lahore, Peshawar, and Karachi.\nAnd I want to be clear, as I have said on numerous occasions, the violence we have seen cannot\nbe tolerated. There is no justification for violence. Of course, there is provocation, and we have\ncertainly made clear that we do not in any way support provocation. We found the video that's at\nthe core of this series of events offensive, disgusting, reprehensible.\nBut that does not provide justification for violence, and therefore it is important for responsible\nleaders, indeed responsible people everywhere, to stand up and speak out against violence and\nparticularly against those who would exploit this difficult moment to advance their own\nextremist ideologies.\nYesterday afternoon when I briefed the Congress, I made it clear that keeping our people\neverywhere in the world safe is our top priority. What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist\nattack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who\nmurdered four Americans. And we are taking aggressive measures at all of our posts to protect\nour staffs and their families along with locally employed people who provide so many important\ncontributions to the work of our missions.\nThe Foreign Minister and I will have a chance to cover a full range of subjects today, and it is no\nsecret that the past year and a half has been challenging for Pakistan and the United States. And\nwe still have work to do to get our bilateral relationship to the point where we would like it to be,\nbut we both recognize that we can achieve more when we work together on a focused agenda.

I look forward to seeing President Zardari next week\nat the UN General Assembly. At each meeting, we are working to identify the strategic goals we\nshare \u2014 and there are many \u2014 and the concrete actions we can each take to accomplish them.\nOur number one shared priority remains pursuing our joint counterterrorism objectives to ensure\nthe security of American and Pakistani citizens alike. We face a common threat from a common\nenemy, and we must confront terrorism and extremism together. Earlier this month, I designated\nthe Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization so we could make full use of every\navailable legal authority to end their deadly attacks. Pakistan's parliament has called for\nexpelling foreign fighters so that Pakistan's territory can be fully under control of the Pakistani\nGovernment and cannot be used to launch attacks against other nations.\nAnd the follow-through on this is challenging but necessary, and we look forward to working\nwith Pakistan as they continue to address these problems. We have both pledged to support a\nsecure, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan, which is vital for the security of the region. And I\nwant to thank Foreign Minister Khar for Pakistan's reopening of the NATO supply lines to allow\nthe movement of goods to Afghanistan.\nWe will discuss the successful first meeting of the Safe Passage Working Group in Islamabad\nwhich brought together Afghan, Pakistani, and U.S. representatives to advance the peace process\nin Afghanistan. The Pakistani Government's public call for insurgents to come forward and talk\nwith the Afghan Government was particularly important. We are ready to work together to build\non these steps, and we will continue our discussions through bilateral consultations and the U.S.-\nAfghanistan-Pakistan Core Group.\nNow, of course, our relationship goes far beyond our shared security concerns, and today we will\ndiscuss the many other ways in which we work together, particularly to create economic\nopportunity for Pakistanis. Foreign Minister Khar and I agree that we need to shift our economic\nrelationship from aid to trade and investment. We are working to help Pakistan attract more\nprivate sector investment. We hope to finalize a bilateral investment treaty soon. And we've\ncreated a Pakistan private investment initiative to help more of Pakistan's small and medium\nsized companies get access to capital.\nOver the past few years, we have seen Pakistan's civilian government begin to put down stronger\nroots. And if elections proceed as planned next year, it will mark the first time in Pakistan's\nhistory that a civilian-led government has served its full term. The United States supports\nPakistan's economic development, and we have said many times that we want to see democracy\nsucceed in Pakistan.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

I am pleased to welcome the Foreign Minister from\nTunisia I'm looking forward to our meeting, We obviously have a great deal to discuss, and I\nwant to thank the Foreign Minister and the Government of Tunisia for their efforts over the last\nweek to help secure our Embassy and the American Cooperative School of Tunis following the\nviolent assaults of last Friday.\nWe are monitoring events closely today. There is no higher priority for President Obama and\nmyself than the safety of our people. We've taken a number of steps around the world to\naugment security and to protect our personnel at diplomatic posts. And we are working closely\nwith host governments in this effort.\nAs I have said before and as is embodied in the Vienna Convention and other international\nagreements, all governments have the duty, the solemn duty, to defend diplomatic missions.\nThey must be safe and protected places so that governments can exchange views and work on\nmany important issues, and leaders across the world must stand up and be counted in rejecting\nviolence and holding violent actors accountable.\nWe are working closely with the Government of Tunisia They have assisted us in enhancing the\nsecurity of our facilities. We've also discussed with them the imperative of bringing to justice\nthose responsible for these violent attacks. And we have offered and will continue to look for\nways that we can assist the new Government of Tunisia in ensuring the rule of law throughout\ntheir country, first and foremost for the people of Tunisia themselves. We look forward to\ncontinuing to build our hew partnership with the Tunisian Government and people. Our\nrelationship is built around the shared principles of all democracies \u2014 a commitment to\nnonviolence, to tolerance, and inclusivity for all people, and to upholding the rule of law.\nThe Tunisian people have bravely put themselves on the road to democracy. They were the first\nof the Arab revolutions and they have made important progress in a very short period of time.\nThey have worked too hard and sacrificed too much over too many years to see their progress\nhijacked at derailed by extremists with Ulric own a5,-.\n,\n,encia.

A25\nHEADLINE: It's not about Rice\nBYLINE: Richard Cohen\nBODY:\nIn 1953, an Army officer by the name of Irving Peress was promoted from captain to major. Peress was a\nleftist, possibly a communist, and word of his advancement in rank reached Sen. Joseph McCarthy in\nWashington. He asserted that the promotion proved the Army was \"soft on communism,\" and he launched an\ninvestigation that transfixed the nation. Peress, by the way, was a mere dentist. He was the Susan Rice of his\nday.\nRice, of course, is a much more substantial figure. She is the U.N. ambassador, a friend of Barack Obama's\nand a member of his Cabinet. Still, the attack on her is so disproportionate to what she is accused of having\ndone - just what was it, exactly? - that as in the Peress case, you have to conclude that there is something more\nat work.\nAt first, I thought we were witnessing just another example of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) doing his\nRumpelstiltskin number - throwing a fit and stomping his feet. It was McCain who first leveled the solemn\ncharge that Rice had lied to the Sunday TV shows about the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.\nShe had characterized it as a spontaneous riot when it was, in fact, a planned attack by a local al-Qaeda affiliate.\nBut Rice was hewing to the early line established by the intelligence community. If the CIA and others were\nwrong - or deceptive - then so, inevitably, was she.\nJust as surely as day follows night, McCain's broadside was echoed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). It\nwas soon taken up by 97 Republicans in the House who found Rice unqualified to become secretary of state - a\npost to which she has not been nominated. \"Ambassador Rice is widely viewed as having willfully or\nincompetently misled the American public,\" they bellowed.\nI think Rice would make a dandy secretary of state. She's close to the president, and that matters a great\ndeal. But she is also seen as overly political and that, as much as her version of Benghazi, is what troubles some\nothers. Oddly enough, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), a former presidential candidate and another potential\nsecretary of state, is seen as much more of a statesmen. He is indeed an independent foreign-policy thinker who\nhas, as in days of old, restored the prestige and importance of the Foreign Relations Committee, of which he is\nchairman.\nBut the awful truth is that it hardly matters who Obama chooses. Foreign policy is run from the White\nHouse and not the State Department. Hillary Clinton is about to retire, and while she has done a commendable\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739841\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

For the most\npart, she executed, not initiated, foreign policy.\nSo what is this fuss all about? Not Rice, that's for sure. It has turned instead into an expression of unease\nabout Obarna's foreign policy and its politicization. The unfortunate Peress came to personify the government's\nalleged indifference to the (equally alleged) communist infiltration of the military and virtually everything else\n(with the possible exception of the American Legion), Similarly, Rice has become the personification of\nunhappiness with the use of intelligence leaks to buff Obanaa's foreign policy image and the conducting of an\namorphous foreign policy. Like Churchill's famous pudding, it lacks theme.\nSyria is an example. U.S. inaction has allowed the crisis to fester. Bashar al-Assad's regime might be\ndusting off its formidable arsenal of chemical weapons, further evidence of how chaotic this crisis has become,\nbut much of the time the White House has just trailed after Turkey or France. The war has spread, a refugee\ncalamity has developed, 40,000 people have died, and jihadists have come to play a prominent role. The Obarna\nadministration has been as lethargic on Syria as it initially was with Libya.\nThis sense of an aimless foreign policy, one lacking any moral fervor (or fiber) irritates conservatives much\nmore than liberals. It certainly enrages McCain, who cannot stomach the big guys kicking little guys around. He\nsees an administration that will not engage the American people on matters of foreign policy - make a case for\nintervention, not just say it's too hard to do.\nThe attack on Rice is unfair and excessive. But the issue is not the person but what she represents - in this\ncase, the administration's 'mobility to articulate a foreign policy that marries American morality to American\npower, not merely American politics.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739841\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Two years ago, Kenyan authorities imprisoned a doctor and\ntwo nurses, falsely accusing them of providing illegal abortions. After a year in prison, the providers were\nfound innocent and released, but it galvanized the legal and provider community who formed a coalition to\nmake abortion less restrictive. It will come as no surprise to you that, as a result of their abortion law, Kenya\nhas one of the highest maternal mortality rates in all of Africa, with an estimated 800 women a day seeking\nthe procedure, often through dangerous means.\nKenya is restarting a long-stalled constitutional review process and they hope to produce a final Constitution\nby next year. Religious groups are on a concerted crusade to include new language in the Constitution which\nwould codify that \"life begins at conception\". The current Constitution is largely silent on the issue. If this fetal\npersonhood amendment goes forward, it would place Kenya in the small community of nations with such a\nprovision. It would clearly mark Kenya as out of stop with countries attempting to institutionalize the African\nUnion's Maputo Protocol, one of the most progressive regional documents on women, development and\nreproductive rights, and with the vast majority of African countries in general. For a country trying to regain\nthe momentum of stability and success it enjoyed until recently, such a policy imposition would be a\nregression for women's rights and for the country writ large.\nI went to Kenya last month to work with the coalition that has formed to strategize against the Constitutional\namendment and to work toward a less restrictive abortion law. I also visited several of our clinics and\nproviders in Nairobi and in nearby villages where Planned Parenthood has programs to train providers in post\nabortion care. You have seen this a million times in your travels around the world, so I don't need to tell you\nhow poignant the stories were of the lives saved and lost, the bravery in standing up to constant government\nharassment, and the fear of what this potential Constitutional amendment will mean to the provision of safe\nmedical services.

Sid\nReturn to the Article\nNovember 13, 2009\nCan the Clinton Coalition Survive Obama?\nBy Sean Trende\nJohn Judis and Ruy Teixeira's well-regarded 2002 work The Emerging Democratic Majority begins with a vignette set in\nVirginia. They tell the story of a telecom executive named Mark Warner, who runs a moderate campaign that appeals to\nupper-middle class suburbanites and working class rural voters, and manages to put together a winning coalition that, if\nimitated in other states, might put the Democrats in power for decades to come.\nDemocrats did build coalitions similar to Warner's, and in fact had been doing so for the better part of a decade. Warner's\ncoalition was essentially Bill Clinton's 1996 coalition. The coalition and brand that Clinton built was an extraordinarily\nsuccessful one for Democrats, breaking the momentum of a resurgent GOP in 1996, and ultimately enabling the election\nof the most liberal President in American History last year.\nGiven this background, it's only appropriate that the first tangible sign that this coalition is coming unglued has come in\nVirginia. Republican Bob McDonnell won the governorship with almost 59% of the vote \u2014 the highest percentage (though\nnot the highest victory margin) for any governor since 1961. The entire Republican ticket won by similar margins, and the\nGOP picked up six seats in the General Assembly. It could have been even worse \u2014 five Democrats won their Assembly\nraces by fewer than 1,000 votes.\nThere are some superficial lessons to be drawn here. After last week's election, it's silly to argue that the GOP brand is\ntoo damaged for them to take advantage of Democratic weakness. And the Democrats' latest spin \u2014 that their weakness\namong Independents was simply a function of more Republicans calling themselves independents but retaining their\nRepublican voting habits \u2014 puts the lie to the argument that Republicans' low self-identification is a salient factor in\nelections.\nBut the most important lesson is this: while there's little predictive value in off-year elections, they do provide snapshots of\nthe mood of the electorate, and the present state of political coalitions. Given Virginia's primacy in the story of Democratic\ncoalition building, it gives us a good snapshot of the state of that coalition. And it's not a pretty one for Democrats.\nThe historical base of the Democratic Party for two centuries has long been what Jay Cost and I call Jacksonians:\nCulturally conservative, hawkish, and populist whites located throughout the South and Border states. They began\nbreaking away from Democrats in the 1950s and 1960s \u2014 their reaction to the Party's embrace of unions, blacks and\nliberals is a story is so well known there's no need to rehash it here.\nBut this group remained at least in play for the Democrats. Clinton inherited a coalition consisting of minorities, liberals,\nurban voters, and a decent remnant of Jacksonian voters in the Ohio River Valley and the South, who still preferred a\nmoderate-to-conservative Democrat to a Republican. This coalition became a majority coalition when Clinton used a\ncombination of fiscal conservatism and social moderation to bring suburban voters on board. This was a huge innovation\nfor Democrats; suburbs like Nassau County, NY, Orange County, CA and Fairfax County, VA had fueled the rise of the\nRepublican parties in those states. Clinton moved them substantially toward his side. This coalition allowed him to win by\neight points in 1996; absent Perot and a last-minute fundraising scandal, he probably would have won by more.\nClinton intuited that suburban voters are, generally speaking, culturally cosmopolitan \u2014 they don't like it when you call\nsomeone \"macaca,\" and aren't crazy about the religious right. But they're generally not particularly socially liberal either,\nand are fans of \"law and order.\" They like taxes low and appreciate economic growth, but like good schools and a clean\nenvironment. Having to balance a bunch of spending priorities with somewhat limited income in their daily lives, balanced\nbudgets are the ultimate \"good government\" indicator for these voters.\nClinton delivered on all of these issues, keeping tax increases fairly small, and balancing the budget for much of his term.\nIn so doing \u2014 and this is very important \u2014 he re-branded the Democrats as the party of fiscal responsibility, economic\ngrowth, moderate taxes, and smart government. In other words, he finally shed the \"Carter\" label for the Democrats. This,\nin turn, made it plausible for his much more liberal heirs to benefit from this presumption of competence for Democrats -\none that they probably would not have enjoyed without him.\nGeorge W. Bush's presidency, in turn, was an upper-middle class suburbanite's nightmare. An aggressive social agenda,\na fiscal trainwreck, two poorly-managed wars and a financial collapse later, these suburban voters trended even more\nheavily Democratic then they were in the Clinton era. By 2008, Democrats held most of the suburban districts around ,\nmajor metropolitan areas, and were threatening in the exurbs. The right Democratic candidate probably could have put\ntogether a massive 2008 Presidential majority, combining minorities, liberals, Jacksonians, Catholics, and suburbanites.\nThe mood of the country was certainly right for a 1920/1932/1952/1980 result.\nBut the Democrats nominated Barack Obama. The party's grip among Jacksonians had weakened since Clinton left the\nstage, but they abandoned Obama completely. Jay Cost and I have detailed this here. This movement is why Obama\nreceived 53% of the vote, instead of the 60% or so we might expect given the voters' attitude toward Bush's Presidency.\nObama was able to win even without this branch of the Democratic party because he generated such intensity among the\nremaining portions of his base. In other words, while his base wasn't as broad as Clinton's, it was deeper. Faced with\nvanishing 401ks and home values, and disgust with Bush's presidency, suburbanites flocked to him. Liberals were\nenthralled to finally elect one of their own. And minorities turned out heavily for the opportunity to elect the first black\nPresident.\nBut this presents a problem. You only get to elect the first black President once, and governing a coalition of suburbanites,\npoor blacks, and upper class liberals isn't easy. It is hard to keep that enthusiasm up. And with the Jacksonian wing of the\nparty gone, if that enthusiasm dissipates, or if one of the coalition groups becomes disgruntled and starts to shuffle out the\ndoor, the party isn't left with much.\nWe see a microcosm of this story in last Tuesday's elections, especially in Virginia. Let's backtrack to 2001, and look at\nthe counties that Mark Warner won.\nThe coalition that Warner built was similar to Clinton's. To oversimplify some, it blended together rural Democrats in the\nmining counties in the west of the state, college voters around Charlottesville, and black voters combined with rural whites\nin the south central and southeastern portion of the state with suburban voters in the northeast. It was a diverse coalition,\nbut it worked.\nNow let's compare Warner's map with Obama's map in 2008:\nThe suburbs stayed in the Democrat's camp, for reasons discussed above. But look what happens in the west! That area\nbecomes solidly Republican. Buchanan and Dickenson counties in the Virginia panhandle voted for Dukakis, Mondale,\nand Adlai Stevenson (twice). Obama became only the second Democrat to lose these counties since the UMW moved in\nduring the 1920s.\nAs I said, this isn't a problem so long as (1) the Jacksonians show a willingness to come back for a candidate other than\nObama and/or (2) the suburbs continue their love affair with the Democrats. But we see indications in Virginia that the\nJacksonian divorce may, in fact, be permanent. Creigh Deeds was from the western section of the state, and seemed \u2014 at\nleast on paper \u2014 capable of remaking the Mark Warner map. It didn't happen, obviously. Let's look at how Virginia\nchanged from Bush's 2000 election to Deeds' loss last week:\nThe redder a county is, the more it moved toward the Republicans from 2000 to 2009; bluer counties moved toward\nDemocrats.\nWe see that McDonnell did as well as Bush did in the suburbs \u2014 but no better. Those pockets of white are the DC\nsuburbs in the northeast, the Hampton Roads area in the southeast, and Richmond just to the north and west of Hampton\nRoads. Its rural Virginia \u2014 which is still about 1/3 of the electorate \u2014 that made the difference between Bush's 54% in\n2004 and McDonnell's 59% on Tuesday. Even with Obama off the ticket, and a much less cosmopolitan figure atop the\nticket, rural Virginia went solidly Republican.\nWe can take another angle here. Deeds and McDonnell squared off in a very close Attorney General race in 2005. Let's\ncompare Deeds' 2005 showing to his 2009 performance. [NOTE: In this map, we look at \"relative movement.\" Because\neverything in the state moved toward McDonnell, a map just showing \"movement\" would be solid dark red, and not of\nmuch use. So instead, if something moved more than 9 points toward McDonnell, it is colored a shade of red, if it moved\nless than 9 points toward McDonnell, it is blue. Think of this as showing the change in the counties' PVI].\nWe see the same result. Just since 2005, rural Virginia has moved sharply against the Democrats. The suburbs haven't\nmoved much at all, relative to the rest of the state, while the more heavily African American counties in the southern\nportion of the state have moved a few notches leftward (in absolute terms, they voted in 2009 as they had in 2005). This\nsuggests lasting damage to the Democratic brand here that is not simply personal to Obama.\nNow let's look at how McDonnell did when compared to McCain in 2008. Again, because the movement here was so\ndramatic statewide, we need to isolate the biggest and smallest changes by looking only at \"relative\" shifts.\nThe western counties of the state didn't shift much from 2008, but that's because they were already giving Republicans\naround 70% of the vote \u2014 there wasn't much room for Republican growth (and remember, \"blue\" in a relative map still\nmeans slight movement toward the Republican since 2008)! The real Republican gains over the past year have come in\nthe DC exurbs, in the 1-95 corridor, and to a lesser extent in the Hampton Roads area.\nIn other words, the Jacksonians aren't returning to the Democrats, at least in Virginia. Deeds might still have been able to\nwin without them, but the Democrats are also showing weakness in the Virginia suburbs. In other words, two pieces of the\nClinton-Warner coalition are starting to break away.\nThis is a real problem for the Democrats. If the suburbanites and the Jacksonians move away from the party, there is\nvery, very little left for them. And there's reason to think that the suburban weakness is real. Obama's fiscal policy, to\nmake an understatement, hasn't been Clintonian. It may not be entirely his fault, but the $787 billion stimulus, the trillion\ndollar healthcare bill, the automobile bailout, and the budget showing trillion dollar deficits extending for the next decade\nmake suburbanites shudder. They don't much like debt, and they intuit this spending is going to have to be paid for at\nsome point \u2014 probably by them. Voters still give Obama some benefit of the doubt, as they do most Presidents in their first\nyear, but they are becoming very, very worried, and probably don't put much stock in Candidate Obama's promise to\nenact a net spending cut any more.\nDemocrats will doubtless chalk this up to Creigh Deeds' inept campaign. Deeds wasn't a great candidate, but when the\nmood of the country is starting to swing against your party, it is hard to run a good campaign. Jerry Kilgore found this out\nwhen he ran in a similar environment in 2005, and was reduced to attacking Tim Kaine for his religious views on the death\npenalty. And if you run the Deeds-McDonnell race in 2006 or 2008, I think its hard to argue McDonnell would win by 18\npoints, even holding everything else equal.\nThe other problem with this explanation is that we saw similar results replicated around the country. Most of the seats in\nthe House of Delegates that the Democrats lost in Virginia, or came close to losing, were suburban. The Philly suburbs\nvoted Republican for the state Supreme Court. Bergen County New Jersey didn't give the Republican 60% of the vote like\nit did in 1984, but Chris Christie nearly carried it, and even though he is significantly more conservative than Christie Todd\nWhitman or Tom Kean, he won the largest margin for a first-term Republican Governor since 1969. Conservative\nRepublicans won elections in Westchester County, New York, and Republicans picked up two City Council seats on the\noutskirts of Queens. Republicans won back the Nassau County legislature -- the Democrats' capture of that body figures\nprominently in the introduction to Emerging Democratic Majority -- and nearly defeated the Democratic County Executive\nthere with an obscure, underfunded candidate. In other words, in places that have never heard of Creigh Deeds or seen\nhis attack ads on McDonell's thesis, the Democrats still lost suburban voters.\nStates with a Democratic base of liberals, urbanites, and minority voters -- like California and New York -- haven't moved\nmuch against Democrats. Obama's polling numbers, as well as those of Democratic candidates for Governor and\nSenator, in classic \"Emerging Democratic Majority\" states like Colorado and Nevada are not looking good at all. And of\ncourse in Jacksonian states like Kentucky, he's below 40%.\nThis doesn't mean that Democrats are doomed in 2010. An improved economy, Republican missteps, and a host of other\nfactors could keep the band together for them. Maybe some of the more marginal voters that Obama brought to the polls\nto enact hope and change will return in 2010 to keep hope alive. But the personal nature of Obama's victory is starting to\nshow its downside for downticket Democrats.\nThe Clinton coalition is looking creaky. If Obama doesn't improve and the coalition comes apart, Democrats could find\nthemselves weaker than they were even in the 1980s and 1990s.\nSean Trende can be reached at strende@realclearpolitics.com.\nPage Printed from:\nhttp://www.realclearpolitics.comiarticles/2009111/13/can_the_clinton_coalition_survivethe_age_of_obama_99046\n.html at November 13, 2009 - 08:19:49 AM CST", "nbr_mention": 2, "sentiment": 2, "sentence": " this was a huge innovation\nfor democrats; suburbs like nassau county, ny, orange county, ca and fairfax county, va had fueled the rise of the\nrepublican parties in those states"}, "Isle of Man": {"mention": ["douglas", "douglas", "douglas", "douglas", "douglas", "douglas", "douglas", "douglas", "douglas", "douglas", "douglas", "douglas"], "text": "http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1284.xml?ReleaselD=1347&What=&strArea=;&strTime=0\nhnt this page Close window\nRelease Detail\nJuly 7, 2009 - Obama's Approval Drops In Ohio - Critical Swing State, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds;\n2010 Senate Race Tips Slightly To Democrats\nWord format\nPresident Barack Obama gets a lackluster 49 - 44 percent approval rating in Ohio, considered by many to be the\nmost important swing state in a presidential election, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today.\nThis is President Obama's lowest approval rating in any national or statewide Quinnipiac University poll since\nhe was inaugurated and is down from 62 - 31 percent in a May 6 survey.\nBy a small 48 - 46 percen t margin, voters disapprove of the way Obama is handling the economy, the\nindependent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University poll finds. This is down from a 57 - 36 percent approval\nMay 6. A total of 66 percent of Ohio voters are \"somewhat dissatisfied\" or \"very dissatisfied\" with the way\nthings are going in the state, while 33 percent are \"very satisfied\" or \"somewhat satisfied,\" numbers that haven't\nchanged since Obama was elected.\nIn the race for Ohio's U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring George Voinovich in 2010, Lee Fisher and\nJennifer Brunner remain neck-and-neck for the Democratic nomination and both would defeat any of the GOP\ncandidates if the election were today.\n\"The economy in Ohio is as bad as anywhere in America. These numbers indicate that for the first time voters\nhave decided that President Barack Obama bears some responsibility for their problems,\" said Peter A. Brown,\nassistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.\n\"Until now voters have given President Obama high ratings on the economy, blaming former President George\nW. Bush for their problems. They might be taking out their frustration on President Obama, possibly deciding\nthat the change he promised has not come as quickly as they expected.\"\n\"Ohio historically has been the prototypical swing state. One of the reasons Barack Obama won the p residency\nby such a wide margin is that he carried Ohio with 52 percent of the vote and captured the lion's share of\nindependent votes,\" Brown added.\n\"Now, by a 48 - 46 percent margin, Ohio independent voters give the President a failing grade on the economy.\nThese numbers indicate that he may be losing, at least for now, some of those who voted for him in November\nand should be an indication to the White House that his honeymoon with the voters may be ending.\"\nIn the Senate race, Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher holds a 24 - 21 percent lead over Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner in\nthe race for the Democratic nomination, with 51 percent undecided.\nFormer U.S. Rep. Rob Portman holds a 33 - 10 percent lead over car dealer Tom Ganley on the Republican\nside, with 55 percent undecided.\nIn general election trial heats, Brunner would defeat Ganley 35 - 31 percent and get 35 percent to Portman's 34\npercent. Fisher leads Ganley 36 - 30 percent and Portman 37 - 33 percent.\nFrom June 26 - July 1, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,259 Ohio voters, with a margin of error of +/- 2.8\npercentage points. The survey includes 483 Democrats with a margin of error of +/- 4.5 percentage points and\n445 Republicans with a margin of error of +/-4.7 percentage points.\nThe Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts public opinion surveys in\nFlorida, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Ohio and the nation as a public service and for\nresearch.

While we had no idea that our trip would correspond with significant\nmilitary advances in the east and the start of the coordinated Tripoli uprising dubbed \"Operation Mermaid Dawn,\" the\ntiming gave us the opportunity to note the contrast between the relative bureaucratic quiet here compared to hyped-up\nactivity in western Libya. Clearly, some coordination is underway between Benghazi and the west: Ali Tarhouni, recently\npromoted to Deputy Prime Minister In a still-to-be-completed cabinet reshufle, previewed the Tripoli uprising with us,\ndown almost to the minute. Yet one feels that, to a large extent, TNC officials are observers and chroniclers rather than\nthe authors of the unfolding developments to the west. (In a telling anecdote, just after confiding in us the plans for\nTripoli about to unfold, Tarhouni turned off his ringing cell phone, to concentrate on talking to us in a leisurely\nmanner.) What TNC officials told us to a large extent was sensible and mostly reassuring in its content -- and the TNC\njust issued a directive reiterating its policy to treat combatants according to the Geneva conventions and observe human\nrights -- but their comments fell mostly in the category of passive analysis rather than aggressive forward\nthinking. Washington has task forces in focused on Tripoli; Benghazi does not\nWhile there's a sense in the air that the final battles have begun, that palpable anticipation does not seem to have\ntranslated into the type of stepped-up bureaucratic activity that one would expect. After meeting with us for nearly two\nhours on Thursday, TNC Executive Committee chair (and PM equivalent) Mahmoud Jibril returned to Doha rather than\nhead any kind of war room here. I was on the ground far longer than Jibril, giving another cameo appearance\nhere. Tarhouni confided that there is no plan for when or how the TNC would relocate quickly to Tripoli, should Tripoli\nfall. TNC Chairman Mustafa Abduljalil (who remains by all accounts a unifying figure here) is a humble, retiring leader,\nwhich after Qadhafi's flamboyance is part of the attraction for Libyans but which does not make him naturally think of\nhow to project INC authority and symbolism quickly to the newly liberated areas. The question is when Tripoli falls, do\nthe extensive plans that the TNC has made about the post Qadhafi transitional structures have any relevance for\nTripoli? I do not want to overplay this: the flags being raised in the western towns are the flags used here. Our visit to\nthe military command center demonstrated that there is active information flow (if not exactly command and control)\npassing between east and west. Tarhouni and others who visit western towns, usually from Tunis, describe support\nthere and from tribal leaders across Libya. No other groups are claiming to have established or planned for an\nalternative civilian authority to compete with the TNC. Still, in our engagement with TNC officials, we will need to\nremind them continually of the imperative to nurture their legitimacy and authority and to prevent a political vacuum\nthat others could fill -- especially after Tripoli falls and the INC is here, not there.\nWe've talked a lot about Tripoli and whether a battle for the capital could be avoided, which we argued would be the\nbest solution. One of the TNC's assets is the moral distinction between what the Libya that the TNC aspires to promote\nand how Qadhafi has treated Libya's citizens. The world's attention will focus on a battle for Tripoli, we cautioned, and\nacts of brutality and revenge and potential internal fights among competing militias will blur that moral distinction even\nmore than the assassination of INC Chief of Staff Abdulfatah Younis already did. The damage to the TNC's credibility\ncould be irreparable. We also noted that a TNC led negotiation that succeeds in winning Tripoli without a fight would\nunderscore the TNC leadership far more dramatically than a successful militia assault only vaguely connected to the\nBenghazi leadership. The TNC officials heard us out patiently, but they clearly were not in the mood to negotiate. They\nfeel confident about the current military situation, and they remain convinced that Qadhafi simply will not give up no\nmatter how high the pressure. If anything, their positions have hardened in recent weeks, with Abduljalil telling us that\nthe TNC will no longer contemplate Qadhafi staying in Libya once he is out of power. Saif Qadhafi is seen in the same\ncategory as his father. I do not believe that anything short of a significant change -- Qadhafi's departure, a military\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739732\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Tarhouni also\nacknowledged with his trademark candor that, to the Libyan people right now, negotiations would appear weak and\nnot a satisfactory climax to the revolution. They do have a point that, despite signs of desperation around Qadhafi (e.g.,\nMohammed Ismail's multiple attempts to contact Gene Cretz and me), there is no indication that Qadhafi himself is\nprepared to throw in the towel. There is real fear that, should Qadhafi somehow make it from Tripoli to Sebha, a guerilla\nwar could persist for years, with supplies and mercernaries smuggled across the Saharan border.\nAmong other topics, we pushed the INC officials hard on starting a high-profile discussion immediately on the\nreconciliation which is part of the TNC's platform. We noted that the many victims of Qadhafi's 42-year rule will be less\nlikely to pursue individual acts of revenge If they are assured that there will be some form to address grievances through\nrule-of-law accountability. The same message should also appeal to average Libyans who for whatever reason remained\nas part of Qadhafi's regime to the end but who have no blood on their hands and might otherwise fear retribution. INC\nofficials refer approvingly to the South African and Moroccan models, and they reiterated their commitment for an\ninclusive process for Libya's future that welcomes all but the most notorious individuals around Qadhafi. Yet they still\nseem to rely largely on (variously described) luck, tribal discipline, and the \"gentle character\" of the Libyan people as the\nbest assurances against abuse and revenge killings. We will continue to push on this.\nBenghazi remained full of chatter about the Abdulfatah Younis assassination. With tribal visits and investigation\ncommittees and cabinet changes, the INC addressed the immediate crisis sufficiently effectively that the intiial tension\nand gunfire quickly dissipated. But the assassination highlighted two realities of Libyan life that TNC officials had\npreviously tried to downplay: tribes and militias. Rather than denying the tribal affiliations of Libyans, TNC officials are\nnow looking to the tribes as part of the solution in enforcing discipline and preventing the type of widescale looting and\npillaging that destroyed Benghazi's security infrastructure in March. Tribes, we heard, can also be a corrective balance\nto Islamist leanings. On reining in the militias, we heard no good answers. Some people (Tarhouni, INC National\nSecurity Advisor Bazama, some civil society representatives) spoke frankly about the problem, including the Islamist\nleanings of the most powerful. The Islamist militias deserve more discussion in other channels, but a couple of people\nnoted that the Younis assassination had an upside in making scrutiny of this issue imperative. Others seemed to rely,\nagain, on luck or tried to avert their eyes from the problem that militias could post on the Day After. There was\nwidespread disdain for Qatar's role in encouraging certain militia elements, and I will be able to cite lots of concern here\nwhen I go to Doha later. Qatar's role, too, is a subject better discussed elsewhere.\nWe also discussed humanitarian and financial needs. Tarhouni and Jibril noted that the TNC's financial needs increase as\nmore territory falls under rebel control; they are worried that, if they can't provide electricity to newly liberated towns\nor fund other services there, disenchantment with the TNC will grow. Tarhouni agreed to reach out to the Indians to\ndiscuss Libya's outstanding debts, to see if he can help us get India's hold on the frozen asset proposal lifted. Briefed on\nSouth Africa's objections, fibril understood the need for continued outreach to Africa (although part of our South Africa\nproblem may derive from Jibril's poor relations with Zuma, with Jibril telling us that he recently accused Zuma of making\nNelson Mandela feel ashamed); Abdulrahman Shalgam will go to the August 25-26 AU Summit and Jibril did not rule out\nattending himself. I've spoken several times to UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed since arriving here, and the\nUAE has finally responded positively to our soft collateral proposal for a loan to the TNC, which may be our fastest way\nof getting funds here, assuming we can come up with a letter that meets the UAE's needs and passes the scrutiny of the\nU.S. interagency process.\nMy traveling companions, Bill Roebuck (NEA/MAG director) and Ben Fishman from the NSS, start their return trip today.\nI will go on to Cairo, Doha, and Abu Dhabi, where, inter alia, I will have more Libya discussions, including seeing Jibril\nagain in Doha. With NileSat continuing to broadcast Qadhafi's propaganda, the Libyan anger over Egypt's role\napproaches if not exceeds annoyance with Qataar. We are also checking on how to get from Cairo back here, should I\nneed to join Chris here in the coming days.\nChris and his tiny staff are doing a heroic job in representing our interests here. I am especially appreciative to DS for all\nthe work done to support my trip.

For others, a place of historic and cultural ties. For all of us, a test of collective\ncommitment and resolve.\nSome may ask why a small nation in the middle of the Caribbean Sea should command our attention today. Why\ncountries in the Western Hemisphere, Europe, the Middle East and Asia should offer assistance to Haiti in the midst of a\nglobal economic downturn that has shaken us all.\nWe're gathered at this conference because what happens in Haiti will resound far beyond the Caribbean and beyond the\nAmericas. The success or failure of this one small nation has economic, social and political implications, not just for its 9\nmillion citizens, but for a region whose future will be shaped by the strength of our commitment to achieve economic\nrecovery, political progress and wider opportunity for people from Portland to Porto Alegre to Port-au-Prince.\nThe United States is here, first and foremost, because it is the right thing to do for our neighbor and friend. Our ties to\nHaiti reach back to the early years of both our nations and have endured for generations-through our struggles for\nindependence; through the defeat of slavery in Haiti, which inspired slaves and abolitionists in the U.S. to press on with\ntheir fight for freedom; and more recently, through the hundreds of thousands of Haitians who emigrated to the United\nStates and strengthened it through their contributions in politics, business, science, sports and culture-the benefits of\nwhich I experienced firsthand as a senator representing New York.\nWe are also here because we are committed to creating a hemisphere in which every nation-no matter their present\nlevel of wealth or current political circumstances-is moving in the same direction, toward greater peace, prosperity,\nfreedom and opportunity.\nWith Haiti, we have the chance through global cooperation and collaboration to stand in solidarity with a people who\nare seeking to march forward. A nation where small investments and assistance from other countries are beginning to\nreap dividends in economic growth, wider access to health care, stronger governmental institutions, greater safety and\nsecurity-and the higher quality of life that results when the material conditions of people's lives improve.\nToday, Haiti is the poorest nation in the hemisphere, with one of the region's biggest gaps between the haves and have-\nnots. But in 2006, Haiti had its highest economic growth since the 1990s. It is on track to reach the completion point for\nthe IMF's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative in the next few months, which means significant debt relief is on the\nway, which will free up approximately $4 million a month-money that Haiti can invest directly in improving the lives of\nits people and building a future of self-sufficiency and confidence.\nHaiti has the region's highest rate of HIV/AIDS, the highest rate of maternal mortality, and the highest rate of child\nmortality. But the numbers of HIV infections and child and maternal deaths are all coming down.\nNot long ago, Haiti endured three decades of a brutal dictatorship. But the national and presidential elections in 2006\njump-started Haiti's democracy, and President Preval and Prime Minister Pierre Louis are seeking to maintain a strong\ncommitment to democratic governance, which will take another step forward on Sunday with elections for the Senate.\nLike many nations, including the United States, Haiti struggles against crime, particularly the global scourge of drug\ntrafficking. But reforms to improve policing, strengthen the justice system and fight corruption are now underway, and\na peacekeeping force led by Brazil has helped bring stability to many Haitian communities.\nHaiti made these strides with help from its own citizens and many of the nations and institutions represented here\ntoday. And this progress did not come only through government-to-government partnerships, but also through links\namong businesses, universities, NG0s, religious and cultural groups, and individuals-the full range of resources and\nrelationships, which is the heart of smart power.\nThat trajectory of progress has been undermined by the combined winds of hurricanes and a global economic recession.\nHaiti is in danger of stalling.\nThis conference gives us an opportunity to reignite its path to progress and work as a team-with Haiti at the helm-to\nadvance a comprehensive, long-term strategy for Haiti's growth, by coordinating hemispheric and international efforts,\ntargeting clear goals, and deploying our diverse skills and resources efficiently and effectively.\nPresident Preval and Prime Minister Pierre Louis have identified what help Haiti needs to get back on track. With these\npriorities as our guide and Haiti as our partner, we can make high-impact investments that will help lay the foundation\nfor stronger democratic institutions, a vibrant civil society, and an open market economy that creates more stability,\nattracts international investment, and offers more jobs and wider economic opportunities for Haiti and our region as a\nwhole.\nNow is the time to step up our investment in Haiti-not because the situation is so dire, but because the consequences of\ninaction could lead to significantly larger costs in both human and financial terms down the road.\nWith $100, we can pay for a year of schooling for one Haitian child or immunize five. That's a tiny fraction of the cost of\nsolving these problems if they escalate over time.\nThe United States will target our support toward three areas that the Haitian government has requested, which are\naimed at promoting conditions that are essential for national and regional progress.\nFirst, the Haitian people need to be secure. They must be able to travel safely to work and school and participate in the\ncivic lives of their communities without fear of violence.\nSecond, the country needs stronger infrastructure, particularly roads, which are the circulatory system of any robust\neconomy. Meanwhile, the people of Haiti are ready to work, but jobs are in short supply. We can accomplish two things\nat once by putting people to work building roads and other infrastructure throughout Haiti.\nAnd third, last year's hurricanes blew a hole in the government's budget.\nNow Haiti is facing a huge deficit, which will make it harder to provide services in the short-term or fund major projects\nin the long-term. Their debt obligations further constrain their ability to lay the groundwork for the future.\nOn each of these issues-security, jobs and infrastructure, and debt relief-the United States is lending its assistance and\nseeking to partner with other nations to maximize our collective impact.\nFirst, security. Effective international partnerships have already helped stem violence and improve security in Haiti. Cite\nSoleil, for example, was a no-man's-land for years, but today, violence has subsided and a new sense of freedom is felt in\nthe streets.\nThe Haitian National Police have been supported in their work by the UN peacekeeping operation in Haiti, which is the\nfirst in the hemisphere in which Latin American and Caribbean nations have participated. Brazil has led the mission with\ndetermination and skill. This level of engagement and collaboration is a major step forward for our region.\nBut criminal networks operating in Haiti have not been eliminated. Haiti continues to fight drug traffickers who have\nmade this country a distribution point for illegal drugs headed to the United States, Canada and Europe.\nDrug trafficking is a problem that involves many nations, all of which have a role to play in ending this deadly trade. That\nincludes the United States. We will give $2 million to fight drug trafficking in Haiti through the Merida Initiative, a plan\nconceived by Mexico, Central America and the United States. This money will fund a secure communications network\nfor the Haitian police; provide a maritime base, vehicles and operational support for police drug units; provide training\nto promote cross-border cooperation between Haiti and the Dominican Republic; and sharpen the investigation and\nprosecution of drug crimes.\nOnce security is established, opportunity can take root. Nations from Canada to Spain to Japan offered generous\nassistance to help repair the damage from last year's storms. Now it is time to take the next step-to move beyond\npeacekeeping and disaster relief to long-term reconstruction and development.\nHaiti has the highest unemployment rate in the hemisphere; 70 percent of its people don't have jobs. It also has one of\nthe region's highest population growth rates. Together, these trends have created what one development expert has\ncalled a \"youth tsunami\"-nearly 1 million youths are expected to come into the job market in the next five years.\nTo spur the creation of jobs, the United States passed the HOPE Act in 2006, to give garments made in Haiti tariff-free\naccess to the U.S. market. Last October, we extended this trade preference for another decade. Apparel is one of the\nlargest sectors in Haiti's economy. We see great potential for job creation in this field, and we are gratified by Brazil's\ninterest in supporting the Haitian apparel industry as well.\nBut to build a diversified economy, Haiti needs more than trade deals. It also needs the infrastructure to support the\nflow of goods and services. The roads in Haiti are beyond inadequate; many communities are isolated by the lack of a\npassable road, which prevents people from holding jobs, children from going to school, and farmers from bringing their\ncrops to market.\nBetter roads could facilitate greater trade and bring more Haitians into the global economy.\nHaiti also needs better roads in tourist areas, to promote that sector of the economy. Other urgent infrastructure needs\ninclude digging water catchments to prevent floods, completing a garment workers' training center, and creating canals\nto help irrigation.\nAs part of the $287 million in non-emergency assistance we will provide to Haiti this year, we have authorized $20\nmillion in aid to generate jobs, to help people put their skills to work building their country's future. We look forward to\nworking with Haiti to distribute that money quickly and effectively, to trigger a virtuous circle for long-term economic\ngrowth.\nAll the fiscal responsibility in the world can't prevent a natural disaster.\nThe hurricanes didn't just wash away crops and houses; they also washed away\nmonths of government planning for the future. Haiti is facing an\napproximately $50 million budget deficit, which could undermine Haiti's long-term ambitions as well as services that\npeople depend on to survive.\nThe United States will provide $20 million to pay Haiti's upcoming debt service obligations, to free Haiti to use its\nresources to fill that budget gap.\n[There is a fourth urgent need that the United States is committed to helping Haiti resolve. The combined effect of\nrising food prices globally and the destruction of crops by the hurricanes have exposed millions of Haitians to\nmalnutrition and its destructive effects on health and productivity. Malnourished people are often too weak to work;\nchronically hungry children struggle to learn in school. Food insecurity is not only a source of suffering, but a direct\nthreat to economic growth and global stability. The United States will provide a $15-million in-kind contribution of food\nto help Haiti as it continues to rebuild. ]\nThese are some of the ways in which the United States is ready to partner with Haiti and other nations. But there are\nadditional pieces of the larger mission that need support-from helping Haiti adapt to climate change so future\nhurricanes won't claim thousands of lives; to strengthening health systems; promoting sustainable agriculture; and\ndeveloping civil society.\nThis work is not only a matter for governments, but also a mission for our people. Here in the U.S., I have heard from\nmany individuals and groups who care about Haiti and want to help it develop but don't know how to invest their time\nand money in a way that will make a real impact. We should think creatively about helping people outside government\nget involved in a meaningful way with Haiti's future. Our people are our most valuable resource, and their potential to\nhelp in places like Haiti has not yet been tapped.\nWe know from empirical data that small investments go a long way. This is something I've seen for myself in my own\nvisits to Haiti. I traveled there with my husband shortly after our wedding, and again years later as First Lady. I met a\ndoctor who had emigrated to the United States and became a U.S. Air Force Colonel, but returned to his home town of\nPignon to run a center for health, women's literacy and microcredit. He and his staff had few resources, but they\noffered a comprehensive range of services to thousands of clients.\nI visited a family-planning clinic where young people were trained to educate their peers about how to protect their\nhealth and prevent teen pregnancy.\nAnd I met with women from a group called Women in Democracy. These women had attended a global conference on\nwomen's leadership in Montevideo, Uruguay, and when they returned home, they created this organization to support\nHaitian women running for office.\nEleven years later, their organization is larger and stronger than ever, and so is their mission. In addition to supporting\nwomen candidates, they also hold trade fairs for women entrepreneurs, run civic education programs to teach women\ntheir rights, support women journalists, and build connections between women throughout the Caribbean.\nThese Haitian women remind us that we will never achieve real progress if we leave millions of people behind. And they\ndemonstrate a powerful commitment on the part of the Haitian people to participate in and lead their nation's recovery.\nOur role is to support their work however we can, and to demonstrate through our actions our belief that their future is\nas important as our own.\nWhat happens next in Haiti will send a message to the world about the power of collaboration on behalf of every poor\nnation that has worked hard to earn a foothold in the global economy but has tumbled in recent months.\nOn behalf of every man and woman in the hemisphere, from the northern expanses of Canada to the southern tip of\nArgentina, who is working harder than ever with fewer resources and for smaller rewards. and the children whose\nfutures have been jeopardized by forces far beyond their control. let us prove our commitment to an economic recovery\nthat reaches not only the citizens of our individual nations but all people everywhere.", "nbr_mention": 38, "sentiment": 5, "sentence": " nations from canada to spain to japan offered generous\nassistance to help repair the damage from last year's storms"}, "Somalia": {"mention": ["somalia", "somalia", "SOM"], "text": "Jack--\nHow did the two PCs go--on At and Somalia aid?", "nbr_mention": 3, "sentiment": 0, "sentence": "Jack--\nHow did the two PCs go--on At and Somalia aid?jack--\nhow did the two pcs go--on at and somalia aid?"}, "Congo": {"mention": ["congo", "congo", "congo", "congo", "congo", "congo", "congo", "congo", "congo", "congo", "congo", "congo", "congo", "congo", "congo", "congo", "congo", "congo", "congo"], "text": "Pis print.\nH <hrod17@clintonemail.com>\nMonday, August 10, 2009 5:07 PM\n'muscatinel@state.gov'\nFw: FYI....

Pretty uncompelling piece if you ask me, but of course I'm biased.\nMitt Romney: A New Course for the Middle East\nRestore the three sinews of American influence: our economic strength, our military strength and the strength of our values.\nDisturbing developments are sweeping across the greater Middle East. In Syria, tens of thousands of innocent people have been slaughtered. In Egypt, the Muslim\nBrotherhood has come to power, and the country's peace treaty with Israel hangs In the balance. In Libya, our ambassador was murdered In a terrorist attack. U.S.\nembassies throughout the region have been stormed in violent protests. And in Iran, the ayatollahs continue to move full tilt toward nuclear-weapons capability, all\nthe while promising to annihilate Israel.\nThese developments are not, as President Obama says, mere \"bumps in the road.\" They are major issues that put our security at risk.\nYet amid this upheaval, our country seems to be at the mercy of events rather than shaping them. We're not moving them in a direction that protects our people or\nour allies.\nAnd that's dangerous. If the Middle East descends into chaos, if Iran moves toward nuclear breakout, or if Israel's security is compromised, America could be\npulled into the maelstrom.\nWe still have time to address these threats, but it will require a new strategy toward the Middle East\nThe first step is to understand how we got here. Since World War II, America has been the leader of the Free World. We're unique in having earned that role not\nthrough conquest but through promoting human rights, free markets and the rule of law. We ally ourselves with like-minded countries, expand prosperity through\ntrade and keep the peace by maintaining a military second to none.\nBut in recent years, President Obama has allowed our leadership to atrophy. Our economy is stuck in a \"recovery\" that barely deserves the name. Our national\ndebt has risen to record levels. Our military, tested by a decade of war, is facing devastating cuts thanks to the budgetary games played by the White House.\nFinally, our values have been misapplied\u2014and misunderstood\u2014by a president who thinks that weakness will win favor with our adversaries.\nBy failing to maintain the elements of our influence and by stepping away from our allies, President Obama has heightened the prospect of conflict and instability.\nHe does not understand that an American policy that lacks resolve can provoke aggression and encourage disorder.\nThe Middle East is a case in point. The Arab Spring presented an opportunity to help move millions of people from oppression to freedom. But it also presented\ngrave risks. We needed a strategy for success, but the president offered none. And now he seeks to downplay the significance of the calamities of the past few\nweeks\nThe same incomprehension afflicts the president's policy toward Israel. The president began his term with the explicit policy of creating \"daylight\" between our two\ncountries. He recently downgraded Israel from being our \"closest ally\" in the Middle East to being only \"one of our closest allies.\" It's a diplomatic message that will\nbe received clearly by Israel and its adversaries alike. He dismissed Israel's concerns about Iran as mere \"noise\" that he prefers to \"block out.\" And at a time when\nIsrael needs America to stand with it, he declined to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nIn this period of uncertainty, we need to apply a coherent strategy of supporting our partners in the Middle East\u2014that is, both governments and individuals who\nshare our values.\nThis means restoring our credibility with Iran. When we say an Iranian nuclear-weapons capability\u2014and the regional instability that comes with it--is unacceptable,\nthe ayatollahs must be made to believe us.\nIt means placing no daylight between the United States and Israel, And it means using the full spectrum of our soft power to encourage liberty and opportunity for\nthose who have for too long known only corruption and oppression. The dignity of work and the ability to steer the course of their lives are the best alternatives to\nextremism.\nBut this Middle East policy will be undermined unless we restore the three sinews of our influence: our economic strength, our military strength and the strength Of\nour values. That will require a very different set of policies from those President Obama is pursuing.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739629\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Jeff\n2 Brothers' Grim Tale Of Loyalty And Limbo\nTo Leave Guantanamo Means Abandoning Family\nBy Del Quentin Wilber\nWashington Post Staff Writer\nMonday, September 28, 2009\nBahtiyar Mahnut, a detainee at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, learned a few weeks ago that the\nPacific island nation of Palau had invited him to settle there.\nIt should have been cause for celebration, especially for a man who desperately wants to be free. But, to the\nsurprise of his attorneys, Bahtiyar has turned down the offer. He wishes to remain a prisoner, they say, so he can\nlook after his older brother, a fellow detainee.\nThe brothers' saga, as related by their attorneys and military records, could transpire only in the context of\nGuantanamo Bay and comes at a critical juncture for the Obama administration, which is struggling to meet a\nJan. 22 deadline to shutter the 223-detainee prison. Their circumstances also highlight the diplomatic difficulties\nfacing the U.S. government as it tries to find places to send prisoners not destined for terrorism trials in the\nUnited States.\nThe brothers are Uighurs, residents of China who are considered separatists by Beijing but are not enemies of\nthe United States. The brothers were picked up separately in Afghanistan and Pakistan soon after the United\nStates launched attacks against al-Qaeda and the Taliban in retaliation for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\nSince at least 2003, the U.S. government has tried to find homes for the brothers and 20 other captured Uighurs.\nFive went to Albania in 2006; four were sent to Bermuda in June. At one point, U.S. officials were considering\nthe possibility of resettling Uighurs in the D.C. region, but that plan was scuttled under political pressure. Most\ncountries have been reluctant to accept Uighurs and risk angering China.\nIn recent weeks, however, Palau has agreed to accept 12 of the 13 remaining Uighurs, according to the Justice\nDepartment.\nThe only detainee not invited by Palau was Bahtiyar's older brother, Arkin Mahmud, 45, who has developed\nmental health problems that are apparently too serious to be treated in the sparsely populated country, said his\nattorney, Elizabeth Gilson.\nTo make matters worse, according to Gilson and military records, Arkin is a prisoner only because he went\nsearching for Bahtiyar after the younger brother left their homeland eight years ago.\n\"This is just very difficult and sad,\" said Abubakkir Qasim, 40, a Uighur freed from Guantanamo Bay in 2006\nwho considers himself a friend of both brothers.\n\"Bahtiyar is turning away freedom for his brother,\" Qasim said through an interpreter. \"His brother is only there\nbecause of Bahtiyar. I feel sorry for both of them.\"\nFive other Uighurs have declined the offer for a variety of reasons, according to one of their attorneys, Susan\nBaker Manning. The Justice Department says the government thinks that six to eight Uighurs will go to Palau.\nThe earliest they could leave would be Thursday, the Justice Department says.\nOfficials at the Defense and State departments and the Palau Embassy in Washington either declined to\ncomment or did not return phone messages.\nIn 2001, Bahtiyar and Arkin, both Muslims, were living with their parents and a younger brother in a small\nhouse in bustling Ghulja in Western China. Arkin is the father of two children, then 8 and 5. The brothers were\nnot particularly devout but felt oppressed by the government of Beijing, which does not allow worship and\nensures the best jobs go to ethnic Chinese. The brothers were forced to survive as menial tradesmen. Bahtiyar\nsold clothes; Arkin repaired shoes.\nBahtiyar wanted to strike out on his own. So, with $700 in his pocket, he headed for Pakistan. But he quickly\nran out of money and couldn't find work. He was worried about being sent back to China until a friend told him\nabout a group of Uighurs in Afghanistan that wanted \"to fight against the Chinese government.\"\n\"If I went,\" he told military officials, \"I didn't have to pay for food or anything. So I went to Afghanistan.\"\nThere, he lived with 35 other Uighurs in a camp of dusty roads and shacks in the southern mountains. The group\nbuilt houses and a mosque. They trained with one automatic rifle and did some push-ups, pull-ups and other\ncalisthenics, records show.\nWithin a few weeks of arriving at the camp, Bahtiyar managed to call home. His mother was very worried and\ntold Arkin to find his brother. \"He left because he was a dutiful son,\" Gilson said.\nAfter the Sept. 11 attacks, the U.S. military began bombing Afghanistan and destroyed Bahtiyar's camp,\nsending the Uighurs into the mountains for shelter. Bahtiyar and others crossed into neighboring Pakistan,\nwhere they were arrested and turned over to U.S. authorities.\nMeanwhile, Arkin made his way to Afghanistan, where he was captured by the Northern Alliance and turned\nover the United States. At a military prison in Kandahar, the brothers saw each other across the razor wire.\nIn 2002, the military brought the brothers and 20 other Uighurs to Guantanamo Bay. Authorities alleged at the\ntime that the men trained at military-style camps affiliated with the Taliban or al-Qaeda. The accusations later\ndissolved upon close scrutiny by the courts.\nArkin and Bahtiyar were confined in separate cells and, for months, were not able to talk. A Uighur interpreter\nworking for the military, Rushan Abbas, persuaded the military in 2003 to allow the brothers to meet in an\ninterrogation room.\nWhen they saw each other, they hugged and wept. \"It was just so emotional,\" Abbas said. \"These brothers from\nacross the world coming together in an interrogation room for the first time.\"\nIn 2005, Arkin remained in solitary confinement. He had a record of disciplinary infractions and had been\ndisrespectful to the guards, records show.\nNot for the first time, Bahtiyar took steps to help his brother. Living in a more relaxed part of the prison, he was\ngranted a request to be moved to Arkin's camp. \"I missed my brother so much,\" he told military officials.\nBy the next year, the brothers had been cleared for release by the military. The government did not present any\nevidence to justify their detention in a federal lawsuit brought the Uighurs seeking their freedom. In October, a\njudge ordered them freed into the United States, but that decision was overturned on appeal. The Uighurs are\nawaiting word, expected this week, on whether the Supreme Court will hear the case.\nLast year, the remaining Uighurs were moved to a fenced-in camp that includes an activities room, video games\nand books. Through it all, Arkin and Bahtiyar have struggled to cope with being prisoners, perhaps for years to\ncome. \"I know I'll die in here,\" Arkin told Gilson not long ago. \"In China, at least I would have a trial and\nsentence.\"\nSince taking their case in 2005, Gilson has met with Arkin dozens of times. But she had only spoken to Bahtiyar\nby phone. He had refused to meet with her, frustrated by lawyers always talking about what he considered\nfruitless legal victories.\nTwo weeks ago, he changed his mind. Bahtiyar felt that he owed her an explanation for refusing Palau's\ngenerous offer. \"Every day here is an eternity,\" he told Gilson through an interpreter. \"But I have to look out for\nmy brother.\"\nJeffrey L.

AM\nAnne-Marie Slaughter is a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton.\nBy Anne-Marie Slaughter\nPRESIDENT Obama says the noose is tightening around Col. Muammar al-Qaddafi. In fact, it is\ntightening around the Libyan rebels, as Colonel Qaddafi makes the most of the world's dithering and\nsteadily retakes rebel-held tow.ns, The United States and Europe are temporizing on a no-flight zone\nwhile the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Gulf Cooperation Council and now the Arab\nLeague have all called on the United Nations Security Council to authorize one. Opponents of a no-\nflight zone have put forth five main arguments, none of which, on closer examination, hold up.\nIt's not in our interest. Gen. Wesley K. Clark argues that \"Libya doesn't sell much oil to the United\nStates\" and that while Americans \"want to support democratic movements in the region,\" they are\nalready doing that in Iraq and Afghanistan. Framing this issue in terms of oil is exactly what Arab\npopulations and indeed much of the world expect, which is why they are so cynical about our\nprofessions of support for democracy and human rights. Now we have a chance to support a new\nbeginning in the Muslim world \u2014 a new beginning of accountable governments that can provide\nservices and opportunities for their citizens in ways that could dramatically decrease support for\nterrorist groups and violent extremism. It's hard to imagine something more in our strategic interest.\nIt will be counter-productive. Many thoughtful commentators, including Al Jazeera's director\ngeneral, Wadah Khanfar, argue that what is most important about the Arab spring is that it is coming\nfrom Arabs themselves. From this perspective, Western military intervention will play right into\nQaddati's hands, allowing him to broadcast pictures of Western bombs falling on Arab civilians. But\nthese arguments, while important, must be weighed against the appeals of of Libyan opposition\nfighters asking for international help, and now, astonishingly, against support for a no-flight zone by\nsome of the same governments that have kept their populations quiescent by holding up the specter of\nforeign intervention. Assuming that a no-flight zone can be imposed by an international coalition that\nincludes Arab states, we have an opportunity to establish a new narrative of Western support for Arab\ndemocrats.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739568\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nIt won't work. The United States ambassador to NATO, Ivo H. Daaider, argues that stopping\nColonel Qaddafi's air force will not be decisive; he will continue to inflict damage with tanks and\nhelicopters, bombing oil refineries and depots on his way to retaking key towns. But the potential\neffect of a no-flight zone must also be assessed in terms of Colonel Qaddafi's own calculations about\nhis future. Richard Downie of the Center for Strategic and International Studies argues that although\nColonel Qaddafi cultivates a mad-dictator image, he has been a canny survivor and political\nmanipulator for 40 years. He is aware of debates with regard to a no-flight zone and is timing his\nmilitary campaign accordingly; he is also capable of using his air force just enough to gain strategic\nadvantage, but not enough to trigger a no-flight zone. If the international community lines up against\nhim and is willing to crater his runways and take out his antiaircraft weapons, he might well renew his\noffer of a negotiated departure.\nIf it does work, we don't know what we will get. Revolutions are almost always followed by internal\ndivisions among the revolutionaries. We should not expect a rosy, Jeffersonian Libya. But the choice\nis between uncertainty and the certainty that if Colonel Qaddafi wins, regimes acrosS the region will\nconclude that force is the livay to answer protests. And when Colonel Qaddafi massacres the\nopposition, young protesters across the Middle East will conclude that when we were asked to support\ntheir cause with more than words, we blinked. Americans in turn will read the words of Mr. Obama's\nJune 2009 speech in Cairo., with its lofty promises to stand for universal human rights, and cringe.\nLet's arm the rebels instead. Some commentators who agree with the analysis above say we could\n'better accomplish our goals by providing intelligence and arms to the opposition. That would, of\ncourse, be much easier for us. It undoubtedly appeals to Mn Obama as a neat compromise between\nthe desire to help the protesters and the desire not to overrule his defense secretary's reluctance to\nparticipate in a no-flight zone. But we would be providing arms not to a disciplined military, but to\nragged groups of brave volunteers who barely know how to use the weapons they have. They need\naction that will change the situation on. the ground for Colonel Qaddafi, as well as his the calculations.\nMoreover, by the time arms and intelligence could take effect, it is quite likely that Colonel Qaddafi\nwill have retaken or at least besieged .Benghazi, the opposition stronghold.\nThe United States should immediately ask the Security Council to authorize a no-flight zOne and\nmake clear to Russia and China that if they block the resolution, the blood of the Libyan opposition\nwill be on their hands. We should push them at least to abstain and bring the issue to a vote as soon as\npossible. If we get a resolution, we should work with the Arab League to quickly assemble an\ninternational coalition to impose the no-flight zone. If the Security Council fails toact, then we should\nrecognize the opposition Interim National Council as the legitimate Libyan government, as France has\ndone, and work with the Arab League to give the council any assistance it requests:\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739568\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

S\nWilliam Hague addresses US fears over Tories'\nEU allies\n\u2022Hillary Clinton 'told antisemitism allegations are a smear'\n\u2022Shadow foreign secretary opposes Tony Blair as EU leader\n\u2022 Ewen MacAskill in Washington and Nicholas Watt\n\u2022 quardian.co.uk, Thursday 22 October 2009 00.33 BST\nWilliam Hague, the shadow foreign secretary, yesterday defended the Conservatives' alliance with far-right parties in\nEurope during a meeting in Washington with the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton.\nHague sought to reassure Clinton about the Conservatives' partners, some of whose members have taken part in\ncommemoration services for the Waffen-SS in Latvia and questioned the need to apologise for an anti-Jewish pogrom in\nPoland.\nThe shadow foreign secretary, who said he had an excellent meeting with Clinton, told her the accusations were part of a\nsmear campaign by the Guardian and others.\nThe row has overshadowed Hague's visit to Washington intended as part of the Conservative preparations for taking\npower.\nSpeaking to the media afterwards, Hague said the behaviour of Michal Kaminski, of Poland's Law and Justice party, was\nnot consistent with anyone who was antisemitic. As for the Latvian party in the Conservatives' European alliance, Hague\nsaid: \"This is a respectable party in Latvia ... To suggest it is antisemitic or neo-Nazi is ludicrous.\"\nJewish groups in the US and in Europe have expressed anger over the Tory links.\nThe state department was careful not be drawn into the issue, not wanting to be accused of interference in UK politics or\nissues relating to the European parliament. A spokesman said: \"I can say that the two had a good, wide-ranging\ndiscussion on a broad range of issues, but can't get into details or substance of that discussion.\"\nHague tried to persuade Clinton that the Conservatives' Euroscepticism would not necessarily mean Britain would play a\nlesser role in European affairs. The US favours the EU acting in unison over Iran and other issues.\nHague said he had raised the allegations of antisemitism with Clinton at the end of a 40-minute discussion on Iran, the\nBalkans, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Afghanistan and climate change.\n\"No one has raised with me all day the other issue, of the parties in our grouping, but I raised that with secretary of state\nClinton because of press reports in your newspaper [the Guardian] and others in case she had seen those,\" Hague said.\n\"I have assured her they are mainstream parties of the centre-right ... The Conservative party rejects what it regards as a\nsmear campaign against some of its members.\"\nHe noted that Kaminski made his first speech in the European Parliament highlighting the problem of anti-semitism in\nEurope and had just completed a successful visit to Israel. \"These are not the habits of someone who is anti-semitic,\"\nHague said.\nAs for the Latvians, of the six governing parties, \"five of them have members involved in the type of commemoration that\nhave been criticised.\" Some were members of the Conservatives' previous alliance, the European People's party.\nOn Conservative Euroscepticism, Hague said: \"I always put the case to all American leaders that it is important to\ndistinguish between Europe's institutions and its capacity to act ... I have explained to her and others that she will be find\na Conservative government very active and activist from the very beginning in European affairs. \"\nLater he said it would be a mistake for Tony Blair to become EU president. He has previously said in private that Blair\nwould be appointed \"over my dead body\".\nhttp://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-10-10/irm-contras-scary-sequel\nIran-Contra's Scary Sequel\nby Art Levine\nThe Daily Beast\nOctober 10, 2009 I 6:55pm\nRepublicans have opened a new front against Obama, a southern front, south of the border\u2014Latin America.\nThe clique of conservatives that has operated since the Iran-Contra scandal and held key policy offices in the\nGeorge W. Bush administration is waging war against Obama in part through Sen. Jim DeMint of South\nCarolina.\nA freshman on the Foreign Relations Committee with no previously known expertise on Latin America, DeMint\nis best known for boasting that health care would be the \"Waterloo\" that will \"break\" Obama. He recently\nprovoked a nasty spat within the committee by requesting funding to travel to Honduras to \"assess\" the crisis.\nThe Obama administration favors reinstalling the democratically elected president, Manuel Zelaya, a leftist who\nwas expelled by the military in June. Committee Chairman John Kerry criticized DeMint for his \"intransigence\"\nin putting a hold on two Obama nominations for State Department jobs in Latin America, and initially denied\nmoney for DeMint's trip. But Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell somehow found funding through the\nDefense Department.\n\"DeMint has been using this issue cynically to hold hostage the entire U.S. policy on Latin America in order to\ndefend a coup,\" says Adam Isacson, a Latin American specialist at Washington's Center for International\nPolicy.\n\"Little Honduras has brought all of the ghosts of the Cold War out of the closet, and paralyzed policy by\nprovoking the [DeMint] holds,\" Julia Sweig, the director for Latin American Studies of the Council on Foreign\nRelations, told me. Some Hill staffers are even blunter: \"These losers from the Bush administration who drove\nLatin American policy off a frickin' cliff are trying to rescue their legacy,\" one aide told The Daily Beast.\nA number of Democrats and foreign-policy experts contend the mounting right-wing attack on Latin American\npolicy has filled a void left by an Obama administration that was too slow to cut aid or take a firmer stance\nagainst the president installed by the Honduran military, Roberto Micheletti. Driven partly by a desire to\nappease opposition in Congress and distaste for left-wing populists the Obama administration \"slow-walked\" its\nresponse to the coup this summer, Sweig says.\nMore recently, though, the administration has toughened its approach by cutting off some vital aid worth at least\n$35 million and blocking Honduran officials' visas. The goal: to pressure the Micheletti regime to enter into\nserious negotiations with the Organization of American States to restore the democratic government and Zelaya.\nInformed observers say that indications of Micheletti's flexibility alarmed some right-wingers in Washington\nand helped trigger DeMint's visit to buck up the regime's resistance.\nAn informal network of right-leaning American advocacy groups and ideologues was entangled in anti-Zelaya\nlegal and PR battles in Honduras before the coup. Among them: Otto Reich, a Cuban-American who headed the\nState Department's now-defunct Office of Public Diplomacy during the Iran-Contra scandal, and was\nsubsequently investigated by a special joint congressional panel\u2014and the U.S. Comptroller General, which\nfound he engaged in \"prohibited covert activities\" by using public funds to attack Reagan's critics. Reich, who\nwas later appointed by President George W. Bush to be assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs and\nis now a private consultant, launched a media campaign against Zelaya before the coup alleging corruption.\n\"Your Loony Left sources say I was an architect of Iran-Contra like they say I'm an architect of the Zelaya\ncoup,\" he told me by phone from Panama. He disputes claims of illegal Iran-Contra activites as \"crap,\"\nasserting they were only based on a fired House staffer's unpublished memo. But Greg Grandin, a Latin\nAmerican history professor at NYU, has a darker view of Reich's role: \"It's kind of the origins of Swift\nBoating,\" he says. \"It's all related to what he's doing now.\"\nConservative supporters of the current Honduran government argue on arcane legal grounds against the\nworldwide condemnation of the coup. \"It's not the first time all, the countries in the world have been wrong,\"\nReich told me. He has criticized what he sees as erroneous reporting on Latin American controversies, taking\nThe New York Times to task for an article last Thursday that he says implied he was being paid to lobby on\nbehalf of the Micheletti regime. \"I guess my facts interfered with [the] story,\" he says. \"Can you believe some\nof my sources say The New York Times is malicious and deserves the slow death it is experiencing?\" A\nDeMint spokesman says the senator hasn't even met with Reich to talk about Honduras, although a Reich aide\nsays they've spoken to DeMint's staff.\nAdding to the mystery of the coup, left-wingers in Latin America and the U.S. have floated what conservatives\nsay are unproven conspiracy theories that Reich somehow played a role in destabilizing Zelaya's regime. He\nhas firmly denied them to The Daily Beast: \"I cannot possibly answer all the Loony Left conspiracy charges\nagainst me. But I will try: I had nothing to do with the removal of Zelaya.\" But the rumors may add to his aura\nof power as founder of Otto Reich Associates. He's drawn more attention to the new Honduras allegations by\npenning a column for the Miami Herald boldly headlined, \"I Did Not Orchestrate Coup in Honduras.\"\nPerhaps the primary influence on DeMint's thinking has been the right-wing Honduran-American lawyer\nMiguel Estrada, whose 2001 nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit was rejected by the\nSenate. In addition to Reich, other former Bush administration officials who have played key roles in\ninfluencing DeMint and in spreading arguments for the Honduran regime include Roger Noriega, a former aide\nto the late Sen. Jesse Helms (the far-right chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee) who also served as an\nassistant secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs from 2003 to 2005. On July 2, Noriega appeared on The\nNewsHour with Jim Lehrer to argue the legitimacy of the new Honduran regime. He was identified as a former\nambassador to the Organization of American States and a visiting fellow of the American Enterprise Institute\u2014\nnot as a paid agent for pro-regime forces.\nNoriega officially registered his firm, Visions America, as representing a Honduran business group only in mid-\nJuly. Yet, the Times reported, he worked with the Association of Honduran Manufacturers to set up meetings\nbetween supporters of the regime and eight U.S. senators\u2014including DeMint\u2014in early July. That visit to\nWashington by Honduran business and political figures from July 2 to July 10, Foreign Policy reported,\noccurred at the same time as a House committee hearing during which Reich\u2014along with a former Honduran\nsupreme court justice and Lanny Davis, a former Clinton administration official and now a lobbyist\u2014testified\nin favor of the current regime. Noriega's office declined to return phone calls about his work.\nThe lobbyist-organized visit also coincided with Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings on Obama's\npicks for top Latin American posts: Thomas Shannon, current assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere\nAffairs, has been nominated to be Ambasssador to Brazil; and Arturo Valenzuela, director of Georgetown\nUniversity's Center for Latin American Studies and senior director for Inter-American Affairs at the National\nSecurity Council during President Clinton's second term, has been tapped to be assistant secretary for Western\nHemisphere Affairs. Both Valenzuela and Shannon were approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\nin late July. Julia Sweig of the Council on Foreign Relations observes, \"They're not polarizing figures.\"\nBut for now they're hostages in DeMint's war. At the July 8 nomination hearings, Valenzuela angered DeMint\nby defending the administration's decision to condemn the overthrow as a coup: \"In my studies of military\ncoups in Latin America, this was a classic military coup,\" Valenzuela said. DeMint's critics contend that he has\ncontinually refused compromise offers from both State Department officials and fellow senators to lift his holds,\nincluding the promise of an extensive floor debate on Honduras before a floor vote on the nominees.\nDeMint's spokesperson, Wesley Denton, says he's acting in good faith out of genuine concern about an\nimportant crisis. \"If these nominees are such a top priority for Democrats, then why hasn't Senator Reid brought\nthem to the floor?\" he asks. \"There is nothing Senator DeMint can do to stop a full debate and roll-call vote on\nthem.\" Technically that's true, but it would be a rare violation of a Senate tradition to do so. DeMint has taken\nup the issue of Honduras, Denton claims, because, \"the State Department's actions were directly relevant to two\nnominees seeking the committee's approval.\"\nYet before DeMint took up the crusade on Honduras\u2014in what critics say is yet another vehicle to \"break\"\nObama\u2014one congressional observer jokes, \"He couldn't find Honduras on a map.\"\nArt Levine, a contributing editor of The Washington Monthly, has written for Mother Jones, The American\nProspect, The New Republic, The Atlantic, Slate.com, Salon. corn, and numerous other publications.

Very big issue when I was in Japan and Korea. Korean parliamentarians want to\nget women and economic growth on the G20 agenda when they have the lead next year and we are advocating for Japan\nto advance the issue at APEC which they are leading this year.\nOn another note, so sad about Smith Bagley. He was a good person and was one of your biggest fans.\nWomen and work\nWe did it!\nDec 30th 2009\nFrom The Economist print edition\nThe rich world's quiet revolution: women are\ngradually taking over the workplace\nGetty Images\nAT A time when the world is short of causes for celebration, here is a candidate:\nwithin the next few months women will cross the 50% threshold and become the\nmajority of the American workforce. Women already make up the majority of\nuniversity graduates in the OECD countries and the majority of professional\nworkers in several rich countries, including the United States. Women run many\nof the world's great companies, from PepsiCo in America to Areva in France.\nWomen's economic empowerment is arguably the biggest social change of our\ntimes. Just a generation ago, women were largely confined to repetitive, menial\njobs. They were routinely subjected to casual sexism and were expected to\nabandon their careers when they married and had children. Today they are\nrunning some of the organisations that once treated them as second-class\ncitizens. Millions of women have been given more control over their own lives.\nAnd millions of brains have been put to more productive use. Societies that try to\nresist this trend\u2014most notably the Arab countries, but also Japan and some\nsouthern European countries\u2014will pay a heavy price in the form of wasted talent\nand frustrated citizens.\nThis revolution has been achieved with only a modicum of friction (see article).\nMen have, by and large, welcomed women's invasion of the workplace. Yet even\nthe most positive changes can be incomplete or unsatisfactory. This particular\nadvance comes with two stings. The first is that women are still under-\nrepresented at the top of companies. Only 2% of the bosses of America's largest\ncompanies and 5% of their peers in Britain are women. They are also paid\nsignificantly less than men on average. The second is that juggling work and\nchild-rearing is difficult. Middle-class couples routinely complain that they have\ntoo little time for their children. But the biggest losers are poor children\u2014\nparticularly in places like America and Britain that have combined high levels of\nfemale participation in the labour force with a reluctance to spend public money\non child care.\nDealing with the juggle\nThese two problems are closely related. Many women feel they have to choose\nbetween their children and their careers. Women who prosper in high-pressure\ncompanies during their 20s drop out in dramatic numbers in their 30s and then\nfind it almost impossible to regain their earlier momentum. Less-skilled women\nare trapped in poorly paid jobs with hand-to-mouth child-care arrangements.\nMotherhood, not sexism, is the issue: in America, childless women earn almost as\nmuch as men, but mothers earn significantly less. And those mothers' relative\npoverty also disadvantages their children.\nDemand for female brains is helping to alleviate some of these problems. Even if\nsome of the new theories about warm-hearted women making inherently superior\nworkers are bunk (see article), several trends favour the more educated sex,\nincluding the \"war for talent\" and the growing flexibility of the workplace. Law\nfirms, consultancies and banks are rethinking their \"up or out\" promotion systems\nbecause they are losing so many able women. More than 90% of companies in\nGermany and Sweden allow flexible working. And new technology is making it\neasier to redesign work in all sorts of family-friendly ways.\nWomen have certainly performed better over the past decade than men. In the\nEuropean Union women have filled 6m of the 8m new jobs created since 2000. In\nAmerica three out of four people thrown out of work since the \"mancession\"\nbegan have been male. And the shift towards women is likely to continue: by\n2011 there will be 2.6m more female than male university students in America.\nThe light hand of the state\nAll this argues, mostly, for letting the market do the work. That has not stopped\ncalls for hefty state intervention of the Scandinavian sort. Norway has used\nthreats of quotas to dramatic effect. Some 40% of the legislators there are\nwomen. All the Scandinavian countries provide plenty of state-financed nurseries.\nThey have the highest levels of female employment in the world and far fewer of\nthe social problems that plague Britain and America. Surely, comes the argument,\nthere is a way to speed up the revolution\u2014and improve the tough lives of many\nworking women and their children?\nIf that means massive intervention, in the shape of affirmative-action\nprogrammes and across-the-board benefits for parents of all sorts, the answer is\nno. To begin with, promoting people on the basis of their sex is illiberal and\nunfair, and stigmatises its beneficiaries. And there are practical problems. Lengthy\nperiods of paid maternity leave can put firms off hiring women, which helps\nexplain why most Swedish women work in the public sector and Sweden has a\nlower proportion of women in management than America does.\nBut there are plenty of cheaper, subtler ways in which governments can make life\neasier for women. Welfare states were designed when most women stayed at\nhome. They need to change the way they operate. German schools, for instance,\nclose at midday. American schools shut down for two months in the summer.\nThese things can be changed without huge cost. Some popular American charter\nschools now offer longer school days and shorter summer holidays. And, without\ngoing to Scandinavian lengths, America could invest more in its children: it\nspends a lower share of its GDP on public child-care than almost any other rich\ncountry, and is the only rich country that refuses to provide mothers with paid\nmaternity leave. Barack Obama needs to measure up to his campaign rhetoric\nabout \"real family values\".\nStill, these nagging problems should not overshadow the dramatic progress that\nwomen have made in recent decades. During the second world war, when\nAmerica's menfolk were off at the front, the government had to summon up the\nimage of Rosie the Riveter, with her flexed muscle and \"We Can Do It\" slogan, to\nencourage women into the workforce. Today women are marching into the\nworkplace in ever larger numbers and taking a sledgehammer to the remaining\nglass ceilings.", "nbr_mention": 3, "sentiment": 2, "sentence": " more than 90% of companies in\ngermany and sweden allow flexible working"}, "Kyrgyzstan": {"mention": ["kyrgyzstan", "kyrgyzstan", "kyrgyzstan", "kyrgyzstan", "kyrgyzstan", "bishkek"], "text": "This is what we propose to put out, with Rs putting out similar:\nToday, Secretary Clinton spoke by telephone with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov.

The city's big powerbrokers and various State Department honchos were there for a party marking Abedin's\nmarriage to Congressman Anthony Weiner of New York. But White House insiders stayed away.\nWell, as Bill Clinton told CNN recently, \"I did everything I could to defeat President Obama and I wanted Hillary to win\" \u2014\nold wounds do not heal overnight. Indeed, they may not heal at all. When my informant said something about the old\ngrievances not going away, the response from the hosts went something like this:\nNo, they don't and they never will. But, we're public servants and suckers for punishment, so we soldier on.\nSpeaking of soldiering on, Mrs. Clinton left for Europe the next day and while Americans celebrated July 4, she was in\nArmenia trying to sort out the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute and.\u2014 equally thankless task \u2014 mediate between Armenia and\nTurkey on their disagreement over what happened in 1915.\nYou've got to salute Hillary. She's got guts to go with that razor-sharp mind. It's a heck of a job being secretary of state\nwhen the White House puts a tight collar around the big issues \u2014 Afghanistan, Iran, Israel-Palestine and Iraq \u2014 and\nyou're left with Nagorno-Karabakh, disputed Ottoman crimes of World War I and, if you're lucky, U.S. bases on Okinawa.\nThe situation might be slightly less troubling if the boys in the White House \u2014 and they are overwhelmingly boys \u2014 were\nforeign-policy heavyweights. They're not. Indeed, I'm told Henry Kissinger refers to them as \"the kids.\"\nChief among them, according to my colleague Helene Cooper, is Denis McDonough, the National Security Council's chief\nof staff. Earlier this month, Cooper wrote: \"Forget Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton or Defense Secretary Robert\nM. Gates. When it comes to national security, Mr. Obama's inner circle is so tight it largely consists of Mr. McDonough, a\n40-year-old from Minnesota who is unknown to most Americans.\"\nI do know McDonough and I've spent a fair amount of time in Minnesota. He has many of the state's qualities: positive,\nbrisk, can-do, affable and efficient.\nBut am I reassured when! read that Obama's national-security inner circle is comprised of him? Nope. He was a great\nguy to control the foreign-policy side of a campaign \u2014 as he did to perfection for Obama \u2014 but he's not a great guy to\nthink big about the world.\nThinking big and bold is required right now. The clock is ticking on momentous presidential decisions. Among them are an\nAfghan extrication that will salvage a minimum of core U.S. security interests \u2014 which will require a bruising negotiation\nwith the Taliban \u2014 and what to do about Iran when it becomes apparent by the end of this year that the latest sanctions\nhave changed nothing. Obama's apparent carte blanche to Israel this month on Iran was disturbing.\nThen there's Israel-Palestine, where Obama can't decide whether the cost of being an honest broker pressure on both\nsides \u2014 is worth the domestic heat he takes for being critical of Israel, with the result that he's zigzagging to little effect.\nAfter firing Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, Obama said he would tolerate debate but not division. My sense is his foreign-\npolicy house is divided \u2014 and the weaker for it. Gen. James Jones, his national security adviser, speaks fine French \u2014\nthe French love that \u2014 but he's left most people unconvinced. Tom Donilon, Jones' deputy, dances around the vacuum\nas best he can. Like McDonough, David Axelrod and Rehm Emanuel were brilliant campaign strategists, but should they\nbe foreign-policy strategists?\nIn Clinton, Obama has a Baker-class secretary of state. For how much longer is he going to delegate her to Nagorno-\nKarabakh? The State Department, a repository of Other underused talent, cannot be the White House annex for non-\ncritical affairs.\nBack in the 1860s, James Gordon Bennett, then the editor of the New York Herald, a forebear of the International Herald\nTribune, gave these instructions to an intrepid foreign correspondent named Henry Morton Stanley:\n\"Draw a thousand pounds now; and when you have gone through that, draw another thousand, and when that is spent,\ndraw another thousand, and when you have finished that, draw another thousand, and so on; but, FIND LIVINGSTONE.\"\nHe was referring to the lost African explorer, David Livingstone, whom Stanley eventually tracked down on Lake\nTanganyika, uttering the immortal words: \"Doctor Livingstone, I presume?\"\nThat sort of journalism's gone out of fashion. So we can all thank Rolling Stone for opening its pocketbook and telling\nMichael Hastings to do whatever it took to find General McChrystal. In his brilliant piece, Hastings did that.

They are surprised to see strangers -- five women and two\nmen -- sitting in the chairs that the boys typically occupy.\nThe students find some empty seats and shrug out of their matching brown coats and mismatched scarves. They\nare curious about the visitors in a lean-back, fold-your-arms, prove-it kind of way.\n\"I'm James Forman,\" begins a 40-something man. \"I'm a professor at Georgetown Law School and -- \"\n\"You related to the James Forman?\" interrupts 17-year-old Carleto Bailey.\n\"I'm James Forman Jr.\"\n\"That your father? James Forman your dad?\" Carleto demands.\n\"Yes, I \"\n\"Wasn't he some big civil rights guy? NAACP? Or SNCC?\"\n\"SNCC,\" Forman says, seemingly surprised that Carleto has heard of his father, who was executive secretary of\nthe Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee for years in the 1960s before becoming active with the Black\nPanthers.\nB6\n\"He's a good guy,\" Carleto continues. \"You tell him that.\"\nForman smiles. \"He passed a few years ago, but he would be happy to hear this,\" the professor says. He scans\nthe room. The Oak Hill students, all African American, are dressed identically in khaki pants and royal-blue\npolo shirts. They have chosen seats on the edges of the room and, after sitting down, have pushed their chairs\nback as far as possible against the wall.\nForman's Georgetown law students -- African American, Arab, Latino, Caucasian -- are in jeans and sweaters.\nThey lean forward, intent and maybe a little bit nervous. \"I teach a class on juvenile justice at the law school,\"\nForman continues. \"And I thought this would be a really good way for law students to learn about juvenile\njustice. There is a certain amount you can learn from reading, but you also need to see and experience things. So\nI thought they would learn a lot from coming out here and hearing about your experiences.\"\nCarleto raises an eyebrow. This is a new one.\n\"And the benefit for you is that they know things about the law that you don't. Ya'll have certain things you\nknow. They have certain things they know. It can be a learning opportunity for everybody.\"\nForman suggests they go around the room and share their names and an interesting fact about themselves.\nDead silence.\nHe smiles encouragingly. \"My name is James Forman, and I helped to start this organization, See Forever, that\nnow runs your school,\" he says.\nCarleto, who has been leaning back on the two rear legs of his chair, brings it down with a bang that sends his\nshort dreads swinging forward and his black plastic rectangular glasses sliding down his nose.\nA few Georgetown students jump.\nHe looks out over the top of his glasses. \"My name's Carleto Bailey,\" he says. \"My interesting fact is that I'm\nfunny./I\nHe gives a wide smile of bright white teeth. The Georgetown students laugh. Oak Hill student Ashawntea\nHenderson, 17, who sits next to him, rolls his eyes. But Carleto's not done: \"And I'm smart.\"\nBut as it turns out, these Georgetown folks -- like his other teachers at Oak Hill Academy -- aren't going to\naccept Carleto's assertion at face value. They want more than good grades, more than the right answers on a\nmultiple-choice test. They want him to prove that he can think.\nForman shows the group an excerpt of a film about juveniles incarcerated at New York's Rikers Island.\nAfterward, the law students want to know whether a label makes a difference. It's a hard question. \"Inmates?\nResidents? Scholars?\" one of them asks. \"Does it matter what you're called?\"\nCarleto studies the woman's face to discern what she wants to hear back. It is blank. He struggles. \"Not so\nmuch,\" he says, finally. He looks at her. She seems unconvinced. He worries that he has given the wrong\nanswer and tries again.\n\"Back in the community, there are certain [police] patrols in the neighborhood who say, 'I know what you're up\nto.' When we come home, some of us are trying to do right, but they basically criticize us because you're already\nlabeled.\"\n\"What are the labels?\" Forman asks.\nThis one is easy for Carleto. He sinks down in his chair and throws it out.\n\"Trouble,\" he says.\n***\nCarleto Bailey is trouble. He is also, as he rightly noted, smart. But he has arrived at Oak Hill Academy with a\nfew disadvantages: He has been poorly educated in the D.C. public schools, was frequently truant and has had\nmultiple run-ins with the law. The D.C. Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services, which runs Oak Hill,\nwon't release information on the specific crime that landed Carleto here because he is still a juvenile, but we do\nknow this is Carleto's second time at the detention center. His academic knowledge is spotty at best. He can tell\nyou who James Forman is, but not where the comma falls in a letter's greeting. (\"Dear, Fidel\" he writes in a\nmock letter to Castro during English class.) He is a fairly typical Oak Hill \"scholar.\"\nAnd, once upon a time, he would have been written off But today, staff at the fledgling Oak Hill Academy are\ndetermined to view the kids' captive time here as a window of opportunity to fill in some of the gaping holes in\ntheir education. Part of the reform initiative of Vincent Schiraldi, director of Youth Rehabilitation Services, the\nschool opened its doors only last year and takes a unique approach to teaching delinquent youth.\nWhat would happen, Oak Hill Academy co-founders Forman and David Domenici wondered, if you seduced\nthese kids with content that was meaningful to them? What would happen if they had lots of good, caring\nteachers in small classrooms? What if one assumed the kids could learn -- and behaved as such? In other words,\nwhat would happen if the District's most challenged students got a private school education, albeit on a campus\nof a decidedly different nature?\n\"The bottom line,\" says Domenici, \"is that the kids most at risk need the highest quality programming, but\nthey've gotten the worst.\"\nIt is this conviction that drove Domenici, who is also the school's principal, and Forman to create three public\ncharter schools for underprivileged and troubled students in the District over the past 11 years. Called the Maya\nAngelou schools, the two high schools and middle school attack educational deficiencies from all angles.\nStudents attend small classes taught by specially trained staff. The high school day stretches from 9 a.m. to 6\np.m., with three meals provided. Some kids, whose home lives prove too chaotic for study, are offered\nsupervised housing in the neighborhood. And it works. Last year, 93 percent of Maya Angelou graduates were\naccepted into two- or four-year colleges, Domenici says. (According to the District's Office of the State\nSuperintendent of Education, 29 percent of students who enter ninth grade in D.C. public schools and city\ncharter schools enroll in postsecondary educational programs within 18 months of graduating high school.)\nIt is a good model. But even though Domenici and Forman were used to teaching court-involved youth -- about\n40 percent of Maya Angelou students had spent some time at Oak Hill -- working inside the gates posed a new\nset of challenges. Youth Rehabilitation Services has been under a court monitor for 23 years due in part to a\nhistory of abuse and poor conditions. When Schiraldi took over the department in 2005 and began his reform\nefforts by implementing a less punitive and more therapeutic detention model at Oak Hill, he saw immediately\nthat changing the school was essential. \"How could I look at my staff at Oak Hill and say we are about\nexcellence when the kids were sitting in a school that was a total waste of time from 9 to 3 every day?\"\nSchiraldi says. Kids sat and watched movies all day. Little, if any teaching was going on, Schiraldi says. \"It was\na miserable, miserable school.\"\nSchiraldi immediately began lobbying the D.C. Board of Education hard to hire someone new to operate the\nschool, and as soon as he got the okay, he put out a request for proposals. Domenici and Forman submitted a\nplan that Schiraldi says \"blew the other ones out of the water,\" and in 2007 were awarded a $12 million contract\nto run the school for the next three years.\nDomenici's and Forman's partnership is a somewhat unlikely one. Domenici is the son of former New Mexico\nRepublican senator Pete Domenici. He went to Stanford Law School, worked in corporate law for a few years\nand then gave it up to teach and work with teen delinquents. Forman is the grandson of Jessica Mitford, who\nwas the daughter of a British baron and a celebrated civil rights activist and journalist. Forman, who graduated\nfrom Yale Law School, worked as a law clerk for Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and as a D.C. public defender.\nAfter seeing how few good schooling options his teenage clients had, he joined forces with Domenici, whom he\nmet through a mutual friend, to start an independent school for 20 students in 1997. A year later, it became part\nof the first Maya Angelou public charter school.\nAt Oak Hill Academy, principal Domenici fights with an occasionally maddening bureaucracy for basics:\nfunctioning boilers, permission for a college tour for a group of six students, classes uninterrupted by\ncorrections staff who sometimes will call three-quarters of the students out in the middle of class to take their\nmeds. Forman is chairman of the Maya Angelou Public Charter School Board of Directors and board member\nof its parent group, the See Forever Foundation. He attacks hurdles from the other side, fundraising and\nadvocating for juvenile justice reform.\n\"When David came out to run the school here, it was like \"Ocean's 12\": Go find all the people you can trust\nfrom your previous mission,\" Forman jokes. That included past colleagues and even a few Maya Angelou\ngraduates. Samantha Crandal Simpore, who had been at a then-coed Oak Hill herself when she was 15 on an\naccessory assault charge, went to a Maya Angelou school and now runs the Oak Hill Academy welcome center.\n\"I tell them, I was here, too,\" Simpore says. She tells each new student about how she was 17 years old and\ndidn't know her multiplication tables, how she rode the bus to school each day hooked up to her Walkman,\nhoping no one knew she was listening to a recitation of times tables. \"I say: 'You're at an intersection in your\nlife. You know what's down the street behind you. Nothing you can do about that. But you have a choice about\nwhat's up the road ahead.'\"\nMany of the 90 Oak Hill students, ranging in age from 14 to 19, come in performing way below grade level, and\nnearly half have been diagnosed with learning disabilities. They are at Oak Hill for an average of 10 months,\ncycling in and out on a schedule that has nothing to do with a nine-month academic year. Out of necessity, they\nare grouped according to the cell blocks they live on to keep opposing gangs separate. Thirteen-year-olds can be\nin classes with 18-year-olds. More than half have been committed to Oak Hill for violent felonies. Fights are\ncommon. (Before the month is out, Carleto will get into a fistfight in the hallway that will delay his release\ndate.)\nThrough the use of small classes -- typically five to 14 teens work with one teacher, a teaching assistant and a\nguard -- the school organizes the curriculum around four-week themes designed to pique students' curiosity and\nget them to think critically about the nature of democracy, social justiCe and their role in the world. For\nexample, during the Relationship theme, students parse the types of relationships ranging from those between\nhumans and the natural world (ancient river civilizations) to those between individuals and groups (Pharaohs\nand their subjects) to those between humans and ideas (liberation theology). At the same time, in English class,\nstudents will be working on the standard five-paragraph essay via the guiding question: \"Why do relationships\nmatter, and how can relationships be both good and bad for people?\" With the current unit, Change, the D.C.\npublic school system's learning standards are woven into the social studies curriculum under loose headings\nsuch as \"Changes in the Way Humans Think About the World and Their Place in It,\" which becomes a way of\nintroducing the scientific revolution, the Enlightenment and the Magna Carta. It's a philosophy that emphasizes\nlearning through making cross-discipline connections long popular in affluent, progressive schools but typically\neschewed in schools for underprivileged kids, where rote learning and a return to such basics often rule.\nOak Hill Academy has also created a course called Advocacy, which the Georgetown law students are co-\nteaching, emphasizing this month's theme. Domenici believes learning how the law works in a democracy \"is\nessential to teaching them to be good citizens.\"\n\"We always believed that one of our roles should be to help kids self-advocate or advocate on behalf of a\ncommunity,\" Domenici says. \"We think this is a good skill for students individually and also one that our\ndemocracy demands.\"\nBut this is an ambitious agenda, and Oak Hill Academy faces significant obstacles. Can you teach teens to think\ncritically when they're missing the basic underpinnings of education? How do you teach empowerment in a\nsetting that demands rigid compliance to keep kids from misbehaving?\nAlthough he sometimes grows discouraged, Domenici does his best to buoy his staff members when they learn\nthat one of their most promising students got into a fight on the unit or \"graduated\" from the program only to\ncommit another crime and be sent back. \"I talk to staff about the fact that, day to day, our job is to do the\nabsolute best work you can in the domain that is within your control,\" he says, reminding them that they don't\ncontrol all the pieces of the puzzle. \"And if you do that well, you have done the moral and just thing.\"\nHis staff members must keep the faith while straddling what are to them two equally potent realities: First,\nknowledge is power, and through possessing it, every student is capable of success. And, absent the right\nsupport, failure lurks right around the corner. It sounds like this: \"I think Carleto has a good chance of finishing\nhigh school and going on to college,\" Domenici says. Pause. \"Also, he is highly at risk of not doing that.\"\n***\nIt is a cold day in late January, and Oak Hill is in the midst of the four-week session on change. Dressed in\njeans, a blue shirt and a gray corduroy jacket (the heat's not working), Oak Hill social studies teacher John\nAdams paces around the room and then stops to bend over Carleto, who is doodling on a piece of paper at his\ndesk.\n\"Pay attention,\" he says, taking Carleto's pencil. \"Carleto, what is today's essential question?\"\n\"What is historical change, and how is it different from other kinds of change?\" Carleto says, reading from the\nboard where Adams has scrawled his topic.\n\"Yes,\" Adams says. He ignores a student who is wandering around the room aimlessly, until the student\nsnatches a hat off a classmate and tosses it toward the hallway. A youth development specialist, which is how\ncorrections guards are referred to under Schiraldi, appears to be deeply engrossed in a magazine in the back of\nthe room. But she snatches the hat from mid-air, scowls at the disruptive student and tucks the hat in her pocket.\n\"Please sit,\" Adams tells the student.\nNot quite sitting, not quite standing, the student perches on the edge of Adams's desk.\nGood enough.\nAdams continues: \"What's the difference between personal change and historical change?\"\nSilence.\n\"Anybody?\nMore silence.\n\"Ashawntea?\"\n\"Historical change is like a revolution,\" Ashawntea says.\nAdams throws out a list of changes -- getting a raise in salary, moving to a new house, the election of President\nObama -- and Carleto accurately sorts the changes into micro and macro, personal and historical.\n\"Obama's campaign was all about change,\" Adams says. \"Do you think he is talking historical change?\" He\nwants the students to think about the president, who has been in office now for two days. What might his first\n100 days look like? he asks the students. \"What advice would you offer him?\"\nCarleto looks stumped.\n\"Just throw out some ideas,\" Adams prompts. He tells the students that they are going to craft their own letters\nto the president, advising him on how to set his agenda for change.\nCarleto slaps his pencil down on the desk. \"Obama's not reading our letters,\" he says. He folds his arms across\nhis chest, skeptical that the president will lay eyes on this letter -- and skeptical, perhaps, that the teachers really\nwant to hear his ideas.\n***\nLater, Carleto will acknowledge that he knows quite a bit about the president, as he is reading Barack Obama's\n\"Dreams From My Father.\" \"It started off as a good book, but it got excellent,\" he says. He struggles hard to\narticulate the book's themes and appeal. \"I don't know how to put it,\" he says finally, \"but growing up with -- no\ndisrespect, but -- a Caucasian mom and an African father, he still made it through.\"\nSitting in a guard's room off the gym on a February evening, the echoing sound of classmates bouncing\nbasketballs around the cavernous gym, Carleto goes on to tell his own possibly apocryphal story.\n\"As a child, he was very fun, happy -- as far as kindergarten through sixth grade. Starting in first grade, he was\non the honor roll and was also making it to school every day,\" he says, beginning in third person, but quickly\nlapsing into first. \"In the late stages of middle school; at the end of eighth grade, I started smoking weed, doing\nstuff I wasn't supposed to be doing.\"\nHe takes full responsibility. \"No one peer-pressured me or anything. I was liking what was going on when I was\nhigh,\" he explains. He, like almost all the teens at Oak Hill, denies being involved in a gang. Still, Carleto says\nthat his best friend since elementary school was killed in 10th grade in \"a neighborhood thing.\" \"Nowadays,\nanyone can just ride up on you, and you can be mistaken for someone else and be shot,\" he says, explaining that\nhis buddy was shot because of a \"miscommunication.\" \"It wasn't intended for us,\" he says, insisting that he and\nhis friend, nicknamed \"Smoke,\" were just waiting for the bus. Then he announces, \"I don't want to talk about\nit.\"\nSo he doesn't, though it clearly haunts him: He will doodle \"R.I.P. Smoke\" on the cover of his blue folder or on\na piece of loose-leaf paper or the comer of the chalkboard.\nHe's happy to talk about Oak Hill Academy though, where he has a 3.5 grade-point average after six months.\n(Domenici says Carleto is in the top 25 percent of students at Oak Hill and tests fairly high on assessments.)\nCarleto likes the school even though it is a bit easy for him, being a senior in with freshman. He complains that\nthe classes are too short and that the guards are always interrupting them to move on just when the class is\ngetting warmed up. That really bugs him, but he doesn't say much. He says that he will be leaving Oak Hill in\ntwo months and intends to finish his schooling at Oak Hill's transition center in the District, from which he says\nhe will graduate this June. When he gets out, there are a couple of things he wants to do right off, he says. First,\nhe intends to see his girlfriend, then go out to a restaurant and then go to \"the Adidas shop in Georgetown,\nwhere my mom will get me some stuff-- and my dad, too.\"\nHe says his mom was pretty upset when he got arrested and sent to Oak Hill. \"She was. . . I'm going to say she\nwas kind of like surprised at my actions, what I done,\" Carleto says. \"You know how they say 'Whatever hides\nin the dark, comes out?'. . . She was not ashamed of me, but disappointed in me.\" Meanwhile, she makes the\nlong, 45-minute trek from the District to Laurel to visit. \"Every weekend, both days!\" he says.\nHe is alternately vague and specific when he describes his family life. He has four brothers -- ages 27, 23, 16\nand 11 -- and reports that he and his two younger brothers live with his mom. He says his mom works as a\nsecretary, but he struggles to remember where. \"She was working with, what's that program downtown by the\nWashington Monument, dealing with Smokey the Bear?. . . I'm trying to think. It's right by the Holocaust\nMuseum. It's a brick building. She works there.\"\nLater, Carleto's school case worker, Essence Jones, will offer a somewhat different account of Carleto's life.\nAlthough Carleto is in 12th grade, he will not graduate in June as he says. He is still six credits shy, Jones says.\nAnd it will be at least three months -- not two -- before his release.\nCarleto's father is not part of his life, Jones says. The teenager had been living with his aunt before coming to\nOak Hill. His mother, who has a rap sheet dating to 1982, has been in and out of jail for years, arrested\nrepeatedly for a string of felonies and misdemeanors, including possession and distribution of drugs, as well as\nprostitution. She has been in prison since 2005, serving three consecutive sentences totaling seven years for\nassault with a dangerous weapon, attempted distribution of cocaine and violation of bail.\nShe is not visiting Carleto on weekends.\n***\nBy the end of February, still in the midst of the unit on change, the Oak Hill teens file into their advocacy class,\njostling each other, edgy. It is unseasonably warm outside, and they do not want to be here. Reluctantly they\ntake their seats, and Carleto positions himself so that he can see the patch of brown grass and mud in the prison\nyard, visible through the door someone has wedged open. Occasionally, a breeze wafts into the room.\nToday, the law students decide to tackle the topic of disproportionate minority confinement. If youths of color\nare 35 percent of the general population in the United States, but 62 percent of the prison population, this is\ndisproportionate minority confinement, the law students explain. They refer the teens to a handout each has on\nthe desk in front of him, an article excerpt from New American Media, \"Racism of the Juvenile Justice System\nRevealed,\" to explain that this isn't simply because people of color commit more crimes: \"African-American\nyouths are 4.5 times more likely, and Latinos 2.3 times more likely, than white youths to be detained for\nidentical offenses. About half of white teenagers arrested on a drug charge go home without being formally\ncharged and drawn into the system. Only one-quarter of black teens arrested on drug charges catch a similar\nbreak.\"\nAlthough youth of color are 100 percent of Oak Hill's population of inmates and, indeed, 100 percent of all 721\njuvenile delinquents currently committed to Youth Rehabilitation Services care in settings across the city,\ndisproportionate minority confinement is a hard concept for the teens to grasp. Georgetown student Abby Fee\ntries a pie graph, a bar graph, a sketch of disproportionate Xs and Os. Blank stares.\nThen it slowly dawns on Ashawntea what they're talking about. \"Hey,\" he says, suddenly sitting forward.\n\"They're switched around! Basically, there's more of us juveniles in prison than white juveniles -- even though\nthere's more of them.\"\n\"Yes,\" Fee says. \"So the population outside the system looks a lot different from that inside the system.\"\nAshavvntea sits back in his chair to mull this over.\nFee and the other law students move the teens from the statistics to a speculative discussion about the reasons\nbehind these figures. They have prepared a role-playing game to coax the teens into thinking about this from\ndifferent perspectives. Then, they want the students to practice advocating for change. \"So, we're going to have\nthree roles,\" Fee says, dividing the teens into pairs. \"One group is a 15-year-old; one group is playing a math\nteacher; and one group is playing a city council member.\"\nCarleto and his partner learn that they are to play a city council member who is preparing a presentation on\nreforming the police department. Carleto doesn't want to be a city council member. He doesn't even want to be\nhere today. He wraps and unwraps his pencil in the bottom of his T-shirt. He puts his glasses on, then takes\nthem off.\n\"How could you maintain better relationships\" with police? Fee asks, settling herself into a chair to help Carleto\nand his partner work through this.\nCarleto throws his pencil down on the table. Won't answer. She asks again. Silence. Finally, he offers a sullen\nchallenge. \"Stop harassing people for no reason?\"\n\"How do you want them to treat people?\"\n\"Equally,\" he says. He picks up the pencil and tap, tat, taps it on the desk. Fee tries to get him to be more\nspecific.\n\"Don't arrest for small problems. Instead, take them home, and tell your family what you're doing,\" Carleto's\npartner says, unconsciously slipping into second person.\n\"And how do you think they can help crime be stopped or decreased in general?\" Fee prods.\nA long pause. Could be their minds are whirring busily; could be they're spacing out. Fee, a teacher before\nenrolling at Georgetown, takes it in stride. She taps the paper a couple of times and repeats the question.\n\"Don't have 10 or 15 cars patrolling and then have an area where you barely see a police car,\" Carleto says.\n\"Patrol each ward equally?\" asks Fee.\nCarleto writes that down, then adds: \"I see a lot of cruel things they done that ain't right.\" Fee nods, encourages\nhim to write it down.\nCarleto's partner grabs the pencil and speaks as he writes. \"The majority of police shouldn't carry guns. I could\nsay, 'The majority of police are racist.'\"\n\"But how would you fix that?\" Fee. prods.\n\"A camera on their car to catch them if they're doing it -- but a secret one,\" Carleto suggests. He sits up\nstraighter in his chair. \"And don't just pull over people because they're black. They can say anything, that's the\nreason why I pulled you over, because your headlights are off or whatever.\" Suddenly, Carleto is on a roll, and\nhe rattles off a list of improvements.\n\"Call to order of the city council,\" says Georgetown student Dania Ayoubi.\nCarleto and his partner stand in the front of the class. \"Hello, I'm Mr. Jones, and I am a city councilman,\"\nCarleto says, glancing down at his paper and twisting the tail of his shirt with his free hand. \"We have some\ncomplaints from the different communities and wards about police, and these are some of our suggestions about\ncracking down on officers.\" He sounds nervous as he begins the list. \"Stop harassing minorities and other ethnic\nyouths, and treat them equal to the same race that you are. Also, police don't arrest if there is a situation at the\nschool like a fight or anything. I feel they should not be arrested but taken home. Then tell their parents why\nthis happened and what the reason was for being stopped by the police.\" He moves briskly through the\nsuggestions and twice, tentatively, tries actually making eye contact with the audience. In conclusion, he says,\n\"verbally abusing\" youth won't be tolerated any more. \"Basically, we want to crack down on the officers and\nhave them removed, if so.\"\nAnother pair of students rises to begin a presentation, but the teens are interrupted by the crackle of a guard's\nwalkie-talkie. \"Time to go!\" the guard announces.\nThe law students are surprised -- they are not quite done -- but politely acquiesce.\n\"Wait!\" Ashawntea says, standing up. \"We got 10 more minutes.\"\n\"It will take you five minutes to get your stuff together and get your coats on,\" the guard says.\n\"But we have 10 minutes!\" Carleto insists. He and Ashawntea sit back down and fold their arms. \"It's only 2:20.\nWe got 10 more minutes still.\"\nThe guard takes a beat, then shrugs and concedes Carleto's point. He goes back out into the hall to wait.\nCarleto shoots Ashawntea a look of surprise. His advocacy worked.\n\"Yesss!\" Ashawntea hisses under his breath.\nKaren Houppert is a contributing writer for the Magazine.

Will update you when I hear from her, and if there is anything else I should do, let me know. All\nbest, Jackie\nps Saw that Foreign Minister Yeo was on your schedule today. Fyi, he is one of my favorite Singaporeans\nbecause of this 2007 speech on China, which he posted to his blog (!):\nApril 12, 2007\nForeign Minister George Yeo's speech at a dinner organised by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy on 5\nFebruary 2007, which he gave off-the-cuff.\nThank you Kishore for your kind words. Dear friends, ladies and gentlemen. I was in India two weeks ago, had\na good trip, spent nine days there. While in Calcutta after calling on the Chief Minister, I had a bit of time to\nlook around so I attended a mass at Mother Theresa's house. Very interesting gathering; there was a Singapore\nnun there, she had been there for over ten years; Sister Maria Tony. I wondered why someone from Singapore\nwould want to dedicate her life to picking up the dead and the dying in the back alleys of Calcutta and living\nthat life. There were many nuns there who were in their ninth year. They take their first vow in the fifth year,\nrenewable every year. In the tenth year they have to decide - final vows for eternity. So if you are not sure,\nplease, there's a way out; if you are sure, then you're in the room. So the priest gave a very tough sermon and\nwhile he was talking, I could hear the din of traffic noise outside, in the streets of Calcutta. Then suddenly, I\nheard the call of the muezzin. Now this is a Hindu city. I told myself, I thought wow, what diversity in this\ncountry, India, and its ability to internalise this diversity and to find it unremarkable that the tiny woman from\nAlbania should come into their midst, become one of them and then when she was beatified, was celebrated as\nan Indian, on the way to canonization.\nChina and India in that comparison- China is not India. China has a very different sense of itself; its deep\ninternal construction is very different. Superficially there are similarities, as there is between China and the US\nand China and Europe. But if you look into it's deep construction, it is very different. When we talk about\nChina's future and China in the 21st century, how China will behave in a world community, China's attitudes\ntowards democracy, towards law, towards social justice. It is important first to look into this deep construction\nbecause that is their nature. Naturally we should not be deterministic, there is nothing inevitable in human\nhistory, but when we understand its nature, it becomes easier to anticipate its moves and you'll be less suprised\nby its actions.\nA few years ago, the Chinese government embarked on a major project which is its dynastic duty- to write the\nhistory of the Qing dynasty, the Manchus, from 1368 to 1644. Ever since the Han dynasty, roughly\ncontemporaneous with the Roman Empire, they developed a historiographic tradition of each dynasty writing\nthe history of the previous period. So Sima Qian of the Later Han wrote of the earlier Han and the entire period\nbefore that; then later on they wrote about the Later Han, Jin wrote up the Three Kingdoms; Ming wrote up the\nYuan: The Yuan, which was Mongol in its origins wrote up the Sung. Sung wrote up the Tang dynasty which\nwas the Classical Period. The last dynasty, the Qing, collapsed in the Republican Revolution of 1911; this is\nnow 2007. I think in 2003, they embarked on this project, 'The Official History of the Qing dynasty'. When the\nformer Vice Premier Li Lanqing was in Singapore recently, I asked him about it. He said \"we told the scholars\nnot to rush this project\". I asked him how long it would take to write this history. He said it would take many\nyears, easily 10 years. I said, \"have you collected the material?\" He said yes. I asked, \"external sources?\" He\nsaid yes, external sources too. All the countries, the Vatican, European countries, the whole lot; all assembled -\n24 official histories, this would be the 26th. And Li's instruction to them was not to be too quick to draw\nconclusions!\nNow Mao Tze Tung was a revolutionary, he was a great revolutionary. He overturned everything before but he\nknew his history, he read the 24 histories, and not only did he read them, he annotated them. But he wrote with\na terrible, illegible scrawl, so scholars had to decipher those scrawls. Then they wrote commentaries on his\ncommentaries and now it's all published. It is very difficult for the Chinese to depart from their own history\nbecause it's the same great plains, the same mountains more or less, the same neighbours more or less and they\nhave seen the same patterns recur. So a long time ago during the Ming dynasty they wrote up the romantic\nperiod of the Three Kingdoms. The first line said: \"Below heaven, great movements, great currents, long\ndisunity leads to unity and long unity leads to disunity.\" So they accept as a part of their own deep nature that\nthere are cycles in their civilisation; that they have ups and downs. In recent years, when you visit them, you\ncould sense them feeling their own re-emergence, it's a bit scary. In the initial years, they were lacking in\nconfidence, they asked many questions, but now they know that there is an organic vitality. It is like an\nadolescent who watches his own development, and conscious of it. I say scary because for those of us who live\non the periphery of that empire, what happens there will radiate its influence on us and eventually, to a greater\nor lesser degree envelope us.\nHow do we see China? I think to begin with, it's important not to try and, from an intellectual viewpoint,\ntranspose our own experiences on to China, because I believe it will develop according to its own logic,\naccording to its own DNA. It is growing now, it will continue to grow, it will develop its own contradictions\nand one day those contradictions, many years from now, will lead to its own decline. So they say at the\nbeginning of a dynasty the taxes are light but the treasury is full, and at the end of a dynasty, the taxes are\ncrushing but the treasury is empty. The important thing to realise about China is that some things are deeply\nresistant to change. Take Confucius. Every time they had to overturn a dynasty, they had to overturn Confucius,\nbecause Confucius justified the status quo. So throughout the 19th century, whether it was the Taiping\nRevolution, the Communist movement or Sun Yat Sen; they spent their lives debunking Confucius. It reached\nits final moment when they criticised Zhou Enlai together with Confucius- no- Lin Biao together with\nConfucius. That was the last paroxysm. Today, Hu Jingtao said [in Mandarin He Xie She Hui ], \"harmonious\nsociety\". Suddenly you hear the resonance of Confucius coming back. And everywhere in the world on the\npattern of Alliance Francaise, the Goethe Institute, the USIA, they establish Confucius Institutes and the\nlearning of the Confucianist classics are coming back with remarkable force in China, not yet in the state\ncurriculum but just parents wanting to teach their children the Confucianist ditties. Now why is this important?\nFrom Mao to Deng to Jiang Zemin, at every stage, they re-interpreted Marx. They are comfortable with the\nyoung Marx, the idea of the superstructure on the economic base, the idea that politics is concentrated\neconomics- that they like. But the class struggle, they downplay. They talk about the Three Represents, the\nprogressive forces, the progressive elements, they nurture those. Now Hu Jingtao says \"harmonious society\",\n\"peaceful re-emergence\". This mindset has a certain attitude towards law, has a certain attitude towards religion,\ntowards democracy and towards foreign policy and I would like, to deal with each in turn.\nJoseph Needham many years ago, I think in the 60's, the man who wrote The Science and Civilisation of China,\nthat great encyclopedic work; he said its not that the Chinese have no legal tradition. In fact, by his estimation,\nthe Chinese had a greater corpus of legal codification than the West. A greater corpus of legal codification than\nthe West! Surprise, surprise. But the idea that the Emperor is below the law, that is completely alien to their\nthinking. Where did that idea come from? Well in the West, you may trace it back to Hammurabi, you may\ntrace it back to Moses, to Greece, to Rome. But if you trace the evolution of that DNA, it goes back, way back,\ninto its early beginnings. The Chinese had a very different evolutionary starting point. It was not in law, it was\nin an idea they call '1i' which is proper conduct among human beings. They believe, deep in their instincts, that\nlaw is only a means towards justice, and that when the outcome of law is perverse, then that law must be\noverridden, because justice, proper conduct, the proper relationship among human beings must take\nprecedence. And to suddenly say that all that had happened in the previous dynasties, all that the earlier\nhistories have summarised, are all wrong and that they should instead adopt something with its origins in\nWestern Europe, which had as its crowning moment the crowning of Charlemagne by the Pope in the year 800;\nto them, what are you talking about? For the Chinese, laws are more like regulations, means towards a larger\nend. Their attitude towards democracy follows a parallel pattern.\nDemocracy is not an end in itself, democracy is a means and they are quite happy to consider democracy as a\nuseful means towards government and that at appropriate places and appropriate levels, democracy is good. So\nat the village and the township level they have democracy, it is a universal franchise. They approve a slate of\ncandidates, and they have fierce elections, fierce campaigning, and those who are incompetent or arrogant or\ndespotic, they get chucked out. But once you reach the level of the cities and the provinces, they say no. No\ndirect democracy. Why not? Because they do not believe, with their view of the universe, that that is the way to\nproduce good government. Any more than the Catholic Church believes that the way to elect the Pope is\nthrough universal franchise. That the parishioners should decide who should be the parish priest. The Parish\nCouncil, maybe, that's ok. But the parish priest? Bishops? Universal franchise? That's against God's laws. They\nhave that kind of instinct embedded in them, it is not Communist, it is just Chinese. And they know that too\nmuch democracy, invariably leads to 'localitis'; of favouritism towards friends, relatives, people who are from\nthe same villages whom we have a relationship with.\nWe have the same problem in Singapore, in fact this problem exists throughout East Asia. Till today, apart from\nSingapore, among Chinese communities and among many East Asian communities, the idea that ultimate\ncontrol of the business should go outside the family is unpersuasive. You talk to Li Ka-shing, you talk to Robert\nKwok, you talk to Lim Soe Liong, you talk to any of them; they will go back to the family. Why? Because they\nbelieve that in the end, what matters at the deepest level, is trust. And the family guarantees you that trust.\nThis is also the Indian wisdom. So you have the Marwaris controlling the economy of Calcutta, you have the\nParsees, you have Sindhis, of which Kishore is a member, you have the Chettiars. They operate on the basis of\ndeep trust and at a completely different level from that of contract law. And because they distrust local\naffiliations, in two dynasties, Ming and Qing, no senior official could serve within 400 miles of where he was\nborn. No local official to serve within 400 miles, so in other words, in Singapore, no Singaporean can govern\nSingapore. They go beyond that, today there's almost no province in China where the provincial leader is from\nthat province. Now you consider this, you transpose this onto Europe, it's as if routinely, the President of France\nis not French. And if you are a German, you are disqualified as a Chancellor of the Republic. And an Italian\ncannot be trusted to serve in Rome. Ancient wisdom! What is remarkable is this is accepted as legitimate. If you\nare Cantonese and you have a Northener squatting over you, you do not consider it perverse or an abomination.\nThis is part of life and in fact, you are more likely to have impartial governor than if a local boy were to be\nthere, because he is more likely to favour those who are related to him or those who are his friends.\nSo when you talk democracy to the Chinese, it is against this cultural backdrop. So what applied to the Qing\ndynasty, the Ming dynasty, they have taken a step further recently in China. They introduced even more rules,\ngoverning the circumstances under which you are disqualified from serving in the area near where you were\nborn. You can't stay in a ministry for too long, you can't stay in a department for too long beacuse if you stay\ntoo long, you develop affiliations and those affiliations will result in sidedoors and guanxi and corruption. Of\ncourse, many of these rules will still be breached, and there will be scandals from time to time and they will act\non those scandals. For as long as the central leadership is pristine, the system can be maintained. But one day\nthey will become corrupt, as in so many previous dynasties, and a downward spiral begins. And it is very\ndifficult in that situation to reverse it.\nSo I mentioned at the table that for India, it's not a country that can sustain a revolution, because its deep\nstructure would not allow for it. I think China is a country which can only be renewed through periodic\nrevolutions. Kishore asked me when- I said well maybe in 200 years time because these are long cycles and\nthey expect as a matter of course that the history of the People's Republic would not be written by the People's\nRepublic. It will be written by the next dynasty. Except that right now they say we shouldn't call it a dynasty,\nwe are now democrats, we are a republic, there is no Emperor...Well, whatever term you call it, it will be done\nmuch later.\nLet me now talk about their attitude towards religion. Being a Roman Catholic I follow quite closely the ups\nand downs in their relationship with the Vatican and I find it quite fascinating. The Jesuits, when they went to\nChina in the Ming dynasty, hoped that they could convert the Emperor, and all of China would become Catholic\nand a great mission would have been achieved. They never succeeded. Some of the brightest minds from\nEurope went there. Matteo Ricci, he corrected the Chinese calendar, he repaired the clocks in the palace, he saw\nthe throne, but he never got to meet the Emperor and he died in China. And his tomb, it's in the compound of\nthe Beijing Party School today. And the church which he founded is still there today. 'Li Matou', that's what he\ncalled himself, he applied for permission to be buried in China and he was given that permission. Then when\nthe Manchus swept southwards, in 1644, the missionaries thought now they had a chance, \"the Manchus will be\na bit more accomodating towards us, we will yet Christianise China\". So if you read the despatches of the\nmissionaries during that period, the Tartar Wars they described it, they were full of hope. But not a chance.\nThey appealed to the Second Emperor, Kangxi.\n\"Can we send more missionaries?\" \"No problem\". \"Can we have them all report to a papal legate in Beijing\"\n\"No such thing\". The Emperor imposed one condition: \"you can send as many priests as you want to China but\nthey must die in China, they cannot leave after that\". You see, instinctively, the Chinese, when they see the\nCatholic Church, they see someone like themselves, someone whose claim to its members is total. And for\nwhom that loyalty is a jealous one.\nMind you they do not try to control everything; they just control the big things, dogma, doctrine. After that you\nare left on your own and you are financially independent, but on the big issue of who appoints ministers and\nprovincial secretaries, it's the same as the Pope appointing Bishops and Bishops ordaining Priests and governing\nthis vast empire, whether we're talking about the Chinese empire or the Catholic empire. They have about the\nsame number of members in the world which is why their interaction is a complex and difficult one. And over\nthe appointment of Bishops, both seek ultimate authority. In the end they have got to find a way to resolve it. I\ncan anticipate the Vatican's argument that \"we are not of this realm, we are of the other realm, so please we are\nnot in conflict\". As for the Chinese leaders, their attitude towards religion from the earliest days is to keep\nreligion at arm's length. Those who govern the empire, they are areligious, they can have private religions, but\nin matters of their public conduct, they are Confucianist. In public, you are not a Catholic, you are not a\nMuslim, you are not a Buddhist. When the Jesuits went to China, they were very impressed by this - that it was\npossible to create a moral order based not on religion but on ethics. So impressed, that they wrote about it, and\ninfluenced people like Voltaire and the other Encyclopedists. It helped inspire the Frence revolution- that you\ncould get rid of the Church, and still maintain a moral order in society.\nI've talked about China and law, China and democracy, China and religion, now let me talk about China and\nforeign policy which is perhaps your greatest interest; about which I can only talk about generally because you\nare the experts in this field. I think it's very difficult for the Chinese to break from their old mindset that they are\n[Zhong Guo], the Middle Kingdom, they are at the center of the Universe, then there are the other 'chopsticks\npeoples' who are semi-Sinic. I think they consider Singapore to be semi-Sinic. Then there are those who are\nbeyond that realm, who are what the Greeks would have called Barbarians. The Mongols, the Manchus, the\nEuropeans, the Americans, the Indians and so on.\nNow all that jargon of course is not in use today. They are very civilised, they will welcome you with great\nhospitality - lavish dinners, very courteous words, offering you the best of everything in the house. It reminded\nme of the way my mother used to teach us at home, we were a big family and the stranger has got to be treated\nwell, the visitor has to be treated well, because you are afraid of the visitor. So you always treat visitors better\nthan your own family members because the visitor is capricious, he can harm you so make sure you fit him in.\nThose who are within your authority, you can always maintain order anyway. This is the way, in their minds,\nthe universe is ordered. So I can understand why the Koreans, the Japanese, the Vietnamese, to some extent, the\nSingaporeans, they feel uncomfortable about what they see as a repetition of a pattern they have seen many\ntimes before in the past. Will the Chinese change this principle of foreign policy, I think they have, because,\nnever in their history have they met, have they existed in close contact with competing centers of power, with\nthe US, with Europe, India, and you are no longer separated by oceans which cannot be crossed, mountains\nwhich cannot be crossed, now they are connected. So they are making adjustments.\nIt will be interesting to watch how they handle their Olympics; if the Olympics become an exercise of pure\nChinese nationalism, I think the international reaction against China will be very severe. But I think the Chinese\nwill be sophisticated. I expect they will organise cheer teams for the Americans, for the Japanese, so that there\nis an appearance of courtesy and common humanity. They are very careful to ensure that their words fit\nconditions today.\nBut let me say in their defence that many of these methods they use arise out of fear, not out of a desire to\ndominate. If you analyse the old tributary system, those who sent tributes got more than they gave in return. It\nbecame a racket. So the Japanese merchants competed to get tokens from [Ryukyu] in order to be able to do the\nChina trade because it meant a lot of money. The Chinese are fearful of foreigners. They are fearful of the\nRussians to the north, the Muslims to the West, the Indians across the Himalayas, but mostly the Americans\nacross the Pacific. Their strategy is to keep the temperature low, low profile, hide the shine of your armour, the\nshine of your sword, just play the game and concentrate on economic development. Internally will they make\npreparations? I have no doubt, because they have a deep fear. Is their intention to dominate, to conquer, the way\nthe European powers did in the past? I don't think so. I don't think there is a great desire to turn non-Chinese\ninto Chinese. Maybe Korea, maybe Vietnam, maybe Mongolia, who at various points in time were part of their\ngreater empire, they might consider worth civilising. But beyond that, Sinicising Indians, Russians? No, I don't\nthink they will want to do that. So as they now become stronger and more powerful, I believe that while their\nold nature will re-assert itself, they will also be reacting to us. If they find the world a threatening place, they\nwill develop their own responses to those threats.\nQuite early in the day, they wanted to neutralise Southeast Asia, Asean. It had never been an area which\nthreatened them, historically. So they didn't worry about Southeast Asia as a threat. But resources, sea lanes,\nthey go through Southeast Asia. And they made a dramatic move a few years ago. Zhu Rongji was here for the\nASEAN-China summit. He said, \"free trade agreement\". At that time when he announced it, the leaders of\nASEAN almost fell off their chairs. We thought of China an economic threat to us. Not as a partner. Took us\nalmost a year to digest the implications and to say yes, let's negotiate. Step by step. And all the time China was\nassuring us that we would benefit more than they would benefit. When the Framework Agreement was signed\nby Zhu Rongji in 2002 in Phonm Penh, he made two remarkable statements. He said if after 10 years, the\nagreement benefits China more than it benefits Southeast Asia, let us renegotiate it. I can never imagine the\nAmerican USTR, or the European Trade Commissioner, talking like that. I mean in a contract, a deal is a deal,\nit's settled for eternity. Then he said: \"China does not seek for itself an exclusive position in Southeast Asia\", so\nhe acknowledged that we were not just going to date one girl, we intended to be promiscuous from the\nbeginning. Towards Northeast Asia, I think it is very complicated, because there is so much history and legacy.\nTowards Central Asia, towards Russia, they have deep fears. Towards America, it has become a relationship\nbound together at so many points, a rupture would become more and more unthinkable. But it is going to be a\nvery difficult relationship, it will be the most important and most difficult relationship to manage in this\ncentury. If it's badly managed there will be war, if it's properly managed there will be another generation of\npeace and hundreds of millions of people in the world would be raised out of the depths of poverty. In this area,\nyou are the experts, but whenever I see China and watch its moves, I go back to its deep nature because it's not\neasy for a country so vast, with such a sense of itself, to depart too much from its deep nature.

Berger\nSamuel R. Berger, chair of the global strategy firm Albright Stonebridge Group, served as national security advisor to\nPresident Clinton from 1997 to 2001.\nPresident Obama's National Security Strategy, released by the White House on Thursday, tackles a delicate but\nunavoidable question: How do we respond to new and old security challenges in an era of financial distress at home and\na reordering of political power abroad?\nFor some time now, it has been clear that the definition of U.S. national security strategy needs rethinking. The\nSeptember 11 attacks, global economic crisis, cyber-terror threats and even the environmental catastrophe in the Gulf\nunderscore that the challenges America faces in 2010 have changed even from just a decade ago. And while America's\nmilitary supremacy is certainly not at risk, new international arrangements - such as the shift from the G-7 club of\npowerful nations to the G-20, which incorporates emerging nations from China to Brazil - are needed so that the costs\nand benefits of a stable international order are shared. The United States cannot solve most global threats without\nothers, nor should we bear the burden alone.\nEnter the National Security Strategy. In my experience, these congressionally mandated documents can easily become\nlaborious and impenetrable, or mere compendiums of bureaucratic pleading from various parts of the government.\n(Make sure you do right by Japan! Don't step on the Pentagon!) The challenge, which President Clinton insisted upon to\nme and his other advisers, is to provide a strategic framework that is clarifying to the rest of the world and informs\nadministration decision makers up and down the line. It's not a blueprint for action, but a means to convey the\npresident's principles and priorities.\nIn Obama's case, the new sober and comprehensive 52-page strategy incorporates the new realities and breaks with\npast strategies in several key respects. But it also reflects an understanding that we face enduring challenges - nuclear\nproliferation, terrorism and regional conflicts - for which the best response is a return to fundamentals.\nOne such fundamental is the strength of our economy. At a time when the after-effects of a financial crisis and the fiscal\nburden of two long wars have raised fears of an overextended America, the administration makes a case for economic\nand technological renewal as a crucial underpinning of U.S. security. The president made this case in his West Point\nspeech last weekend. \"At no time in human history,\" he said, \"has a nation of diminished economic vitality maintained\nits military and political primacy.\"\nAnother fundamental challenge is arms control and nuclear proliferation. By seeking strategic arms cuts with Russia, the\npresident has returned to a long bipartisan tradition that languished during the prior administration. And by convening a\nglobal summit on securing nuclear material this spring, Obama has given new urgency and global purchase to the effort\nstarted in 1991 when Sens. Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar first initiated a program to lock down nuclear materials.\nOn terrorism, the strategy builds on the past, but breaks with it as well. Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama each have\ndeployed all of America's tools: military power, homeland defense, law enforcement, sanctions, intelligence and\nvigorous efforts to cut off terrorist financing. But the critical difference in the Obama strategy is that it rejects the Global\nWar on Terror lens through which the prior administration viewed the challenge. \"This is not a global war against a tactic\n- terrorism - or a religion - Islam,\" the new strategy says. \"We are at war with a specific network, al-Qaeda and its\nterrorist affiliates.\"\nThis sharper focus avoids alienating many in the Muslim world, ensures the support of key allies who never accepted the\nbroader construct and avoids the overreactions that led us to forsake the fight against al-Qaeda fight in Afghanistan and\nturn our efforts to the unrelated threat from Saddam Hussein's Iraq.\nIn perhaps the most dramatic departure from the strategy of its predecessor, the Obama administration has restored a\nless provocative policy on the use of military force. In the 2002 national security strategy, President Bush articulated the\nrationale for preemptive war just weeks before seeking a U.N. resolution to invade Iraq. The new strategy restores the\nprinciples that have guided administrations for decades: the use of force should be a last resort, should weigh all the\ncosts and benefits, and should have as much international support as possible. The administration reserves the right to\nact unilaterally - for example against al-Qaeda and its allies - but resurrects the principle President Clinton often\ndescribed as \"together where possible, alone where necessary.\"\nPresident Obama's critics have focused on his diplomatic engagement with hostile states like Iran and North Korea. The\nPresident sets forth his rationale: \"to create opportunities to resolve differences, strengthen the international\ncommunity's support for our actions, learn about the intentions and nature of closed regimes, and plainly demonstrate\nto the public within those nations that their governments are to blame for their isolation.\"\nIn the case of Iran, Washington's outstretched hand has not resulted in Iran's compliance. But attempts to engage have\nhelped ensure that the world's attention is focused on Iran's intransigence rather than Washington's refusal to\nnegotiate.\nWithout a doubt, there are gaps between principle and practice. Despite the Obama administration's stated goal of\ndoubling exports in the next five years, it has not put its muscle behind trade agreements with South Korea, Panama and\nColombia. And the clarity of its call to respect human rights has at times been muted in the face of tough realities.\nSixteen months into this administration there has been much progress, but many of the true tests of this strategy lie\nahead.\nIn the strategy's conclusions, the Obama administration evokes an even earlier era, calling for both political parties to\nrestore the cooperation and common purpose so crucial to our success during the dark days of the Cold War. Despite\nthe intense debates at the time over nuclear arms control, Central America and d\u00e9tente, nearly all American supported\nthe containment of communism.\nIn that same spirit, the administration's framework deserves broad bipartisan support. We can and should argue out our\ndifferences over detention of prisoners, methods to disarm dangerous states, how hard to push for democratic rights, or\nthe costs of climate change legislation. But at the same time, we can rally around the overriding U.S. foreign policy goals\nspelled out in the strategy: renewing our economy at home to ensure leadership abroad; defeating al-Qaeda; succeeding\nin Afghanistan; preventing nuclear proliferation; curbing climate change; and promoting an international order of\nenlightened self-interest, economic prosperity and the fundamental values upon which America is based.", "nbr_mention": 2, "sentiment": 0, "sentence": " despite the obama administration's stated goal of\ndoubling exports in the next five years, it has not put its muscle behind trade agreements with south korea, panama and\ncolombia"}, "Taiwan, Province of China": {"mention": ["taiwan", "taiwan", "taiwan", "taiwan"], "text": "sbwhoeop\nTuesday, November 17, 2009 8:57 AM\nH\nFYI: Lead FT editorial today, must if you haven't read.

As has become fashionable to note, events have instead obliged\nBarack Obama to play the role of washed-up debtor visiting his stern bank manager for yet another loan.\nThat analogy is useful. But it can be overdone. Certainly, the financial crisis has brought into sharp relief just how\ndependent the US has become on foreign creditors, chief among them China.\nIt has also sharpened the perception of what had been happening anyway, the relative decline of a US-centric west and\nthe relative rise of a China-centric Asia. But the word relative is important. China, poor and riddled with internal\ncontradictions, is not there yet, by a very long way.\nThe changing relationship with China does demand a new tone. But early indications are that Mr Obama is still fumbling\nfor the right one. Take global imbalances.\nIn the only set-piece speech of his Asian tour \u2014 delivered in Japan, perhaps to assure his hosts that Washington is not\nabandoning Tokyo just yet \u2014 Mr Obama correctly pointed out that the global economy cannot go back to business as\nusual. \"One of the important lessons this recession has taught us is the limits of depending primarily on American\nconsumers and Asian exports to drive growth,\" he said.\nThat is quite right. But his entreaties on global rebalancing fall flat in China. That is partly because Beijing remains publicly\nsceptical about the US's long-term finances.\nFrom China's perspective, Mr Obama's emergency measures to stimulate the US economy and persuade Americans to\nspend their way out of recession smack of re-creating the spendthrift ways that triggered the crisis in the first place.\nThat explains why Chinese officials have quizzed their US counterparts so robustly about how they intend to pay for\nhealthcare reform. It is also why Beijing has started questioning US monetary, as well as fiscal, policy.\nOn the eve of the US president's visit, Liu Mingkang, China's chief banking regulator, took a swipe at the US Federal\nReserve, saying the combination of a weak dollar and low interest rates risked generating a global asset bubble. That is a\nbit rich coming from someone who oversees a banking system that has pumped the equivalent of nearly 30 per cent of\ngross domestic product into the economy so far this year. But it reflects the new tone with which China presumes it can\naddress a humbled superpower.\nMr Obama's efforts to occupy the moral high ground are also undermined by his flirtation with protectionism, particularly\nhis decision to slap tariffs on Chinese tyres.\nHis administration has failed to spell out a convincing trade policy \u2014 and that is seen as a stark omission for-a business-\noriented Asian audience. Such perceived deficiencies have hobbled his ability to cajole China with any real conviction.\nWhen it comes to human rights, too, the US seems to have drawn the conclusion it is not good policy to badmouth its\nchief creditor.\nHillary Clinton, secretary of state, set the tone early when she said that human rights should not \"interfere\" with matters of\nimplicitly greater urgency. Mr Obama obligingly omitted all references to Tibet, Xinjiang and even Taiwan from his Tokyo\nspeech. There was also not a single mention of India, a potential regional counterweight to China, yet another indication\nthat Washington is behaving as though it is treading on eggshells. It was therefore all the more refreshing to hear Mr\nObama criticise Chinese censorship during his town hall meeting in Shanghai on Monday \u2014 though even that could not\nundo his own self-censorship in refusing to meet the Dalai Lama before this week's trip.\nIt is right and proper that the US acknowledge the rising significance of China. Mr Obama's assurances that China's rise\nneed not be a threat were spot on. But by the same token, US accommodation can be taken too far. Contrary to common\nperception, China's huge holdings of US treasuries are not a sign of great strength. They are evidence of how dependent\nChinese growth has been on the US consumer.\nEqually, any idea that China, with an economy less than a third the size of the US and a GDP per capita roughly the same\nas Angola's, can somehow save the world is ludicrous. Mr Obama is right to show respect to China. He need not \u2014 and\nmust not \u2014 kowtow.\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2009. Print a single copy of this article for personal use.

I am making FM calls re Afghanistan which are going well and the memcons will describe the\nspecific responses for our followup, especially in Athens and Brussels.\nBelow is a memo from a concerned observer about the British feeling alienated from us.\n/Let me know what you each think. Thx.\nConsensus across the board in Britain\u2014center, right, left\u2014is that the Atlantic alliance\u2014the special relationship\u2014the\nhistoric bond since World War II\u2014is shattered. There is no dissenting voice, not one, and there are no illusions. Opinion\nis unanimous. The bottom line is that the Obama administration's denigration of the UK is seen as the summation of the\nBush era.\nUndoubtedly, you saw this week Minister of Defense Bob Ainsworth's public criticism of Obama's indecision and his\naccusation that the president is indifferent and damaging to British interest. While Downing Street sought to ameliorate\nhis remarks with an oleaginous statement his view is simply what everyone\u2014everyone\u2014thinks. His clumsy outburst was\na classic gaffe\u2014an embarrassing mistake because it reveals something true.\nThe Chilcot inquiry of Parliament, publicly conducting hearings on the origins of UK involvement in the Iraq invasion,\nhas put Bush's war on terror\u2014and British involvement\u2014on trial\u2014and the calmly conducted but eviscerating hearings\nwill go on for another year. Blair is seen as either complicit on the basis of knowing there was no casus belli or as an\nenthusiastically deceived tool. Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has stated that the reason support for the\nAfghanistan mission has cratered is because of the lies told in the run-up to the Iraq war\u2014another view universally held.\nMeanwhile, former UK ambassador to the US Christopher Meyer has published his new book on the history of UK\ndiplomacy with concluding sections on the demise of the special relationship. He is not only being interviewed on all\nBritish media but also has appeared as a voluble witness before the Chi!cot commission. All British newspapers and\njournals have prominently published many pieces within the last week on the decline and fall of the US-UK relationship.\nPlease see the lead editorial today from the London Times and the cover story from the Spectator\u2014two of the most\nresolutely pro-American sources. The tone is not resentful, but reserved, disdainful and superior. The US administration\nis considered blinkered, parochial and counter-productive.\nConservatives are more contemptuous than Labour, which feels abandoned and somewhat baffled. Rather than eager\nto be Obama's poodle, Cameron would be superficially friendly and privately scornful. Class has a lot to do with the\ncontempt. A Cameron government would be more aristocratic and even narrowly Etonian than any Conservative\ngovernment in recent history, sharply contrasting especially with the striving and classless perspective of the grocer's\ndaughter, Margaret Thatcher.\nAnd yet, the most recent poll this week showed Labour within striking distance of the Tories, about five points down,\nthe result of a slight economic uptick. A hung parliament seems very possible. Given the distribution of voting patterns,\nLabour need not win a plurality to have more seats than the Tories.\nThe slight buoyancy for Labour in this unique situation has only heightened anxiety about Obama's Afghanistan\nprocess, which has excluded the British government from significant consultation and consideration of its interests. See\nthe lead to Con Coughlin's Spectator piece.\nTherefore, the President might contemplate a brief stop in London going to or coming from Oslo or a meeting in\nCopenhage to make a public appearance with Brown. And, others in the Administration should pay special attention to\nBrown to secure strong support from him, and more importantly, the whole government and British establishment\nshould be reassured that we do value their stalwart support despite the ups and downs of the last eight years.\nPasted below is the Times editorial and the link to the Spectator article.\nFrom The Times\nNovember 26, 2009\nAtlantic drift\nWashington's delay in announcing its Afghanistan strategy has left Brown drifting. Obama needs to invest more time and\nattention in the transatlantic alliance President Obama declared on Tuesday that \"the whole world\" had a responsibility\nto help the US-led mission in Afghanistan. He would, he said; soon lay out the \"obligations of our international partners\".\nThose partners have been waiting a long time for the details. On Monday the President had his tenth meeting with his\nadvisers to work out his strategy for Afghanistan. He has now spent almost three months considering his options, and\nhas promised an announcement on deployments after the Thanksgiving holiday.\nFor Gordon Brown, this cannot come too soon. After the United States, Britain is the largest contributor of troops to the\nNato operation in Afghanistan. There has never been any suggestion that Britain has enough soldiers to pursue a\nseparate strategy or that it can operate independently of the US forces, which already number some 68,000 troops.\nUntil the White House decides whether to send an extra 40,000 or some figure significantly lower than the number\nrequested by General Stanley McChrystal, Mr Brown cannot properly plan the best support strategy.\nIt is becoming sadly apparent that Britain has been left drifting by the delays in Washington, and that the Obama\nAdministration is largely unaware of the embarrassment this is causing the Government. More worryingly, this does not\nseem to be a source of concern within the Administration. Downing Street, diplomatically, turns aside any suggestion\nthat it is frustrated by the nonchalance with which it is being treated. But the insistent questions on Afghanistan, the\nanger caused by the steady stream of returning war dead and the rapid crumbling of public support for the war cannot\nbe answered effectively until Mr Brown is taken into American confidence and seen as a full partner in the Nato\ncampaign.\nOn the surface, the continuing high regard in Britain for the dynamic and articulate new President has masked these\ngrowling complaints. Mr Brown is not suffering, as his predecessor did, from the taint of close association with a deeply\nunpopular US president. On the contrary: like several European leaders, he is still eager to position himself as close as\npossible to Mr Obama to clothe himself in some of the President's European popularity. But within Government, there is\nalready worry that Britain's voice counts far less than it did in the past. This is not simply another instance of the\npersistent but pointless British anxiety over the so-called special relationship; it is a justified concern that two of the\nmain pillars of the Nato alliance should have policies and strategies that are closely co-ordinated and sympathetically\nunderstood on both sides when fighting a war.\nThe fault, glaringly, is on the American side. The White House no longer seems to be monitoring the reactions and\npolitical options of its transatlantic allies. It is not sufficient to suggest that the Administration sees little point in\ninvesting time and diplomacy in a British government likely to be defeated in the coming general election; wartime allies\nhave interests that go far beyond the political make-up of the government of the day. Mr Obama promised during his\nelection campaign to revive trust in American leadership and to re-engage in multinational diplomacy. In office, he has\ncertainly voiced the same ideals; but he has invested little in giving new substance and dynamism to the transatlantic\nrelationship.\nOn Afghanistan, Mr Brown has sometimes been left speechless by Washington. He talks of sending 500 extra troops. But\nuntil he knows the likely US strategy, he cannot outline his own. Atlanticism is always fragile on the Left and was\nstretched to breaking point by Tony Blair. It is now being undermined by indifference in Washington. Today America is\nenjoying Thanksgiving. Tomorrow it must look out again to its all\nTHE SPECTATOR\nA special form of disrespect\nCon Coughlin <http://www.spectator.co.uk/search/authorfisearchString=Con%20Coughlin>\nWednesday, 18th November 2009", "nbr_mention": 18, "sentiment": -3, "sentence": "\nuntil the white house decides whether to send an extra 40,000 or some figure significantly lower than the number\nrequested by general stanley mcchrystal, mr brown cannot properly plan the best support strategy"}, "Morocco": {"mention": ["morocco", "morocco", "morocco", "morocco", "morocco", "morocco", "morocco", "morocco", "morocco", "morocco", "morocco", "morocco", "morocco", "morocco", "morocco", "morocco", "morocco", "morocco", "morocco", "morocco", "morocco", "morocco", "morocco", "morocco", "morocco", "morocco", "morocco", "morocco", "rabat"], "text": "- do you approve the War Powers Act action memo?\n- The King of Morocco has not gotten' back to us with a time but ops will try again when its a reasonable hour for the\nMoroccans.\n- Attorney General Holder has requested to speak with you regarding the Department of Justice's Libya investigation.

As we work to\nsecure our personnel and facilities, we have confirmed that one of our State Department officers\nwas killed. We are heartbroken by this terrible loss. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family\nand those who have suffered in this attack.\nThis evening, I called Libyan President Magariaf to coordinate additional support to protect\nAmericans in Libya. President Magariaf expressed his condemnation and condolences and\npledged his government's full cooperation.\nSome have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted\non the Internet. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs\nof others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation.\nBut let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.\nIn light of the events of today, the United States government is working with partner countries\naround the world to protect our personnel, our missions, and American citizens worldwide.\nStatement on the Death of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya\nSeptember 12, 2012\nIt is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel in\nBenghazi, Libya yesterday. Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens\nand Foreign Service Information Management Officer, Sean Smith. We are still making next of\nkin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all their families and\ncolleagues.\nA 21 year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he\nsustained in the attack on our office in Benghazi.\nI had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke\neloquently about his passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This\nassignment was only the latest in his more than two decades of dedication to advancing closer\nties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a Peace Corps\nVolunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans\non the ground in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to\nbuild the foundation for a new, free nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work\nthat he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's values and interests, even when\nthat meant putting himself in danger.\nSean Smith was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten years ago.

Prior to arriving in Benghazi, he served in Baghdad, Pretoria,\nMontreal, and most recently The Hague.\nAll the Americans we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this\nvicious and violent attack that took their lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan\npeople reach for a better future.\nAmerica's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country.\nWe are honored by the service of each and every one of them.\nRemarks on the Deaths of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya\nSeptember 12, 2012\nYesterday, our U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya was attacked. Heavily armed militants\nassaulted the compound and set fire to our buildings. American and Libyan security personnel\nbattled the attackers together. Four Americans were killed. They included Sean Smith, a Foreign\nService information management officer, and our Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. We are\nstill making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals.\nThis is an attack that should shock the conscience of people of all faiths around the world. We\ncondemn in the strongest terms this senseless act of violence, and we send our prayers to the\nfamilies, friends, and colleagues of those we've lost.\nAll over the world, every day, America's diplomats and development experts risk their lives in\nthe service of our country and our values, because they believe that the United States must be a\nforce for peace and progress in the world, that these aspirations are worth striving and sacrificing\nfor. Alongside our men and women in uniform, they represent the best traditions of a bold and\ngenerous nation.\nIn the lobby of this building, the State Department, the names of those who have fallen in the line\nof duty are inscribed in marble. Our hearts break over each one. And now, because of this\ntragedy, we have new heroes to honor and more friends to mourn.\nChris Stevens fell in love with the Middle East as a young Peace Corps volunteer teaching\nEnglish in Morocco. He joined the Foreign Service, learned languages, won friends for America\nin distant places, and made other people's hopes his own.\nIn the early days of the Libyan revolution, I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition.\nHe arrived on a cargo ship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships with\nLibya's revolutionaries. He risked his life to stop a tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a\nbetter Libya. The world needs more Chris Stevenses. I spoke with his sister, Ann, this morning,\nand told her that he will be remembered as a hero by many nations.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

He spent 10 years as an information management officer\nin the State Department, he was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary\nassignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather, with whom I spoke this morning. He was a\nfather to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being proud of the\nservice their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and\nfinally to Benghazi.\nThe mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary,\nand we and the people of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy.\nToday, many Americans are asking \u2014 indeed, I asked myself\u2014 how could this happen? How\ncould this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from destruction?\nThis question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be.\nBut we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group \u2014\nnot the people or Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a\ncountry scarred by war and tyranny, they were hailed as friends and partners. And when the\nattack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post. Some were wounded.\nLibyans carried Chris' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to\nsafety. And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the\nviolence and pledged every effort to protect our people and pursue those responsible.\nThe friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty\nof this attack. A free and stable Libya is still in America's interest and security, and we will not\nturn our back on that, nor will we rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and\nbrought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities to move swiftly and\nsurely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American\nembassies, consulates, and citizens.\nThere will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher\npriority than protecting our men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine\nthe precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault. Some have sought to\njustify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our Embassy in Cairo\nyesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the intemet. America's commitment\nto religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear \u2014 there is\nno justification for this, none. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long\nas there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a\ntrue and lasting peace.\nIt is especially difficult that this happened on September I I th. It's an anniversary that means a\ngreat deal to all Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet\nfinished, that the job of putting an end to violent extremism and building a safe and stable world\ncontinues. But September 11th means even more than that.

Doherty in Benghazi, Libya\nSeptember 13, 2012\nThe attack on our diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya on Tuesday claimed the lives of four\nAmericans. Yesterday, I spoke about two: Ambassador Chris Stevens and Information\nManagement Officer Sean Smith. Today, we also recognize the two security personnel who died\nhelping protect their colleagues. Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty were both decorated\nmilitary veterans who served our country with honor and distinction. Our thoughts, prayers, and\ndeepest gratitude are with their families and friends. Our embassies could not carry on our\ncritical work around the world without the service and sacrifice of brave people like Tyrone and\nGlen.\nTyrone's friends and colleagues called him \"Rone,\" and they relied on his courage and skill,\nhoned over two decades as a Navy SEAL. In uniform, he served multiple tours in Iraq and\nAfghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in dangerous posts from\nCentral America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well as the arm of a warrior,\nearning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. All our hearts go out to\nTyrone's wife Dorothy and his three sons, Tyrone Jr., Hunter, and Kai, who was born just a few\nmonths ago.\nWe also grieve for Glen Doherty, called Bub, and his family: his father Bernard, his mother\nBarbara, his brother Gregory, and his sister Kathleen. Glen was also a former Navy SEAL and an\nexperienced paramedic. And he put his life on the line many times, protecting Americans in Iraq,\nAfghanistan, and other hotspots. In the end, he died the way he lived \u2014 with selfless honor and\nunstinting valor.\nWe condemn the attack that took the lives of these heroes in the strongest terms, and we are\ntaking additional steps to safeguard American embassies, consulates, and citizens around the\nworld. This violence should shock the conscience of people of all faiths and traditions.

Well, let me welcome our friends and colleagues\nfrom Morocco here to the Benjamin Franklin Room on the eighth floor of the State Department\nfor this very important first session of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue. Before I begin to\naddress the significance of this Strategic Dialogue and the next step in our long relations with\nMorocco, I want to say a few words about the events unfolding in the world today.\nWe are closely watching what is happening in Yemen and elsewhere, and we certainly hope and\nexpect that there will be steps taken to avoid violence and prevent the escalation of protests into\nviolence.\nI also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to these\nprotests in a number of countries. Let me state very clearly \u2014 and I hope it is obvious \u2014 that the\nUnited States Government had absolutely nothing to do with this video. We absolutely reject its\ncontent and message. America's commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very\nbeginning of our nation. And as you know, we are home to people of all religions, many of\nwhom came to this country seeking the right to exercise their own religion, including, of course,\nmillions of Muslims. And we have the greatest respect for people of faith.\nTo us, to me personally, this video is disgusting and reprehensible. It appears to have a deeply\ncynical purpose: to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage. But as I said yesterday, there\nis no justification, none at all, for responding to this video with violence, We condemn the\nviolence that has resulted in the strongest terms, and we greatly appreciate that many Muslims in\nthe United States and around the world have spoken out on this issue.\nViolence, we believe, has no place in religion and is no way to honor religion. Islam, like other\nreligions, respects the fundamental dignity of human beings, and it is a violation of that\nfundamental dignity to wage attacks on innocents. As long as there are those who are willing to\nshed blood and take innocent life in the name of religion, the name of God, the world will never\nknow a true and lasting peace. It is especially wrong for violence to be directed against\ndiplomatic missions. These are places whose very purpose is peaceful: to promote better\nunderstuiding across countries and cultures. All governments have a responsibility to protect\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Now, I would\nnote that in today's world with today's technologies, that is impossible. But even if it were\npossible, our country does have a long tradition of free expression which is enshrined in our\nConstitution and our law, and we do not stop individual citizens from expressing their views no\nmatter how distasteful they may be.\nThere are, of course, different views around the world about the outer limits of free speech and\nfree expression, but there should be no debate about the simple proposition that violence in\nresponse to speech is not acceptable. We all \u2014 whether we are leaders in government, leaders in\ncivil society or religious leaders \u2014 must draw the line at violence. And any responsible leader\nshould be standing up now and drawing that line.\nI wanted to begin with this statement, because, as our Moroccan friends and all of you know, this\nhas been a difficult week at the State Department. I very much appreciate, Minister, the\ncondolences your government expressed to our Embassy in Rabat And even though that tragedy\nhappened far away in Benghazi, we found a reminder of the deep bounds that connect Morocco\nto the United States. It was in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco that one of the Americans\nwe lost this week, Ambassador Chris Stevens, fell in love with the region when he served as a\nPeace Corps volunteer there. That experience set him on a decades-long career of service. So in\nthe memory of fallen friends and colleagues, let us remind ourselves of the many ways in which\nriot just our governments but the people of our two nations have worked together to build a better\nfuture.\nIn many ways, the United States looks to Morocco to be a leader and a model. His Majesty King\nMohammed deserves great credit for the work you've undertaken. In fact, after my visit to Rabat\nearlier this year. I told my team: \"We need to start a Strategic Dialogue with Morocco.\" No\ncountry has been a friend of the United States longer than Morocco. You were the first nation to\nrecognize us back in 1777. But we're not satisfied with simply having a friendship that is\nlongstanding We want one that is dynamic, growing, looking toward the future. So let me\nhighlight a few of the areas we should focus on today.\nOn political reform, we have all seen remarkable changes taking place across North Africa and\nthe Middle East. I commend Morocco and your government for your efforts to stay ahead of\nthese changes by holding free and fair elections, empowering the elected parliament, taking other\nsteps to ensure that the government reflects the will of the people. Today, our political working\ngroup will discuss how the United States can continue to support your efforts to translate\ncommitments into actions. Because as we all know, democracy, real reform, require that people\nthemselves feel the changes in their evetyday lives: the courts reformed, the government more\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

We know that child brides are less likely to get an education, more likely to face\nlife-threatening problems, particularly around child birth and delivery, which not only\nshortchanges them but can even rob them and their communities of their lives and talents. So we\nwant to encourage the government and civil society to continue their important work together on\nthis issue.\nWith regard to the Western Sahara, the United States continues to support efforts to find a\npeaceful, sustainable, mutually agreed-upon solution. U.S. policy toward the Western Sahara has\nremained consistent for many years. We have made clear that Morocco's autonomy plan is\nserious, realistic, and credible, and that it represents a potential approach that could satisfy the\naspirations of the people in the Western Sahara to run their own affairs in peace and dignity. We\ncontinue to support the negotiations carried out by the United Nations and hope parties can work\ntoward resolution.\nWith respect to the economy, our second working group will focus on what more can be done to\ndeliver tangible economic benefits. Morocco's economy is relatively healthy, but you face the\nsame problem that is now endemic across the world \u2014 unemployment is still too high, especially\namong young people.\nThat's why the United States is providing $1.5 million to support an effort to attract foreign\ninvestors, foster local economic development, and combat corruption across the region. And I'm\npleased to announce that later this year we will hold a Morocco business development\nconference here in Washington to connect businesses from both countries.\nToday, we should discuss ways to build on all of these efforts by increasing bilateral trade, a\nparticular goal of mine since so much trade from Morocco goes to Europe. I'd like to increase\nthe amount of trade coming to the United States, and also to improve economic integration\nacross North Africa, which could greatly benefit Morocco because of Morocco's stability and\nMorocco's very strong economic foundation. The greater integration there is, the greater the\nbenefits for Moroccans.\nThird, the attack in Benghazi this week reminds us that security remains a vital issue. Through\nour work together on the Global Counterterrorism Task Force, the United States and Morocco\nalready share crucial information and best practices, and I thank Morocco for hosting a Global\nCounterterrorism Task Force workshop on threats in the South Atlantic next month.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

And so we are\npartnering to help strengthen Morocco's criminal justice system and law enforcement.\nThere will be a lot to discuss in the meeting today. And let me add, the United States greatly\nappreciates the constructive role Morocco is playing on the UN Security Council, especially your\nsupport for the effort to end the violence and bloodshed in Syria and help to usher in a new\ndemocratic future for that country. I commend Morocco for offering to host the next ministerial\nmeeting of the Friends of the Syrian People, and we look forward to continuing to work closely\ntogether as close partners even after your term on the Security Council has ended.\nFinally, our education and cultural ties are reason for much celebration. This year marks the 30th\nanniversary of our official program to facilitate academic exchanges and other bonds between us.\nThere are more than 5,000 Moroccan alumni of these programs. Two are with us today \u2014 Dr.\nBenjelloun and Dr. Ouaouicha \u2014 and we thank them. But among all our work on this front, from\npreserving Morocco's historic sites to empowering youth, there's one area I particularly hope we\ncan focus on today and receive your advice and counsel \u2014 namely, interfaith dialogue.\nIn these tense and turbulent times, it's more important than ever for people of different faiths to\nexchange ideas, to build understanding, to promote religious tolerance. It's one of the great\nchallenges of the 21st century, and it's one that we must address together.\nSo we have a lot of work to do, Minister, but our friendship runs long and deep, and as the treaty\nour nations signed in 1786 says, and I quote, \"Trusting in God, it will remain permanent.\" I'm\nconfident that we will continue to solve problems and produce results that make our nations\nstronger, more peaceful, more secure, more prosperous, and also contribute to doing the same for\nthe world.\nSo again, let me welcome you, Minister. It's been a great pleasure for me to get to know you, to\nwork with you, to be your colleague bilaterally, regionally, and globally, and also welcome your\ndistinguished delegation.\nThank you. (Applause.)\nRemarks at Reception Ntlarking Eid ul-Fitr\nSeptember 13, 2012\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Good evening, and although I am many weeks overdue in saying it:\nEid Mubarak.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nTonight, our gathering is more somber than any of us would like. This comes during sad and\ndifficult days for the State Department family. We lost four Americans. They were good and\nbrave men. They were committed to the cause of building a brighter future for the people of\nLibya. And we condemn the violence in the strongest terms, the violence against our posts in\nBenghazi, in Egypt, and now in Yemen.\nThe Libyan ambassador is with us tonight, and I want to take a moment to thank him for the\nsupport that his government and the Libyan people have shown to the United States in this\ntragedy, particularly the outpouring of feelings of grief and loss because of the killing of our\nambassador.\nAmbassador Aujali, would you mind saying a few words?\nAMBASSADOR AMU: [redacted]\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Ambassador. I know that that was a very\npersonal loss for you, as it was for me. I'm the one who sent Chris to Benghazi during the\nrevolution to show support and be able to advise our government about what we could do to\nbring freedom and democracy and opportunity to the people of Libya.\nReligious freedom and religious tolerance are essential to the stability of any nation, any people.\nHatred and violence in the name of religion only poison the well. All people of faith and good\nwill know that the actions of a small and savage group in Benghazi do not honor religion or God\nin any way. Nor do they speak for the more than one billion Muslims around the world, many of\nwhom have shown an outpouring of support during this time\nUnfortunately, however, over the last 24 hours, we have also seen violence spread elsewhere.\nSome seek to justify this behavior as a response to inflammatory, despicable material posted on\nthe intemet. As I said earlier today, the United States rejects both the content and the message of\nthat video. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of\nothers. At our meeting earlier today, my colleague, the foreign minister of Morocco, said that all\nprophets should be respected because they are all symbols of our humanity, for all humanity.\nBut both of us were crystal clear in this paramount message: There is never any justification for\nviolent acts of this kind. And we look to leaders around the world to stand up and speak out\nagainst violence, and to take steps to protect diplomatic missions from attack.\nThink about it. When Christians are subject to insults to their faith, and that certainly happens,\nwe expect them not to resort to violence. When Hindus or Buddhists are subjected to insults to\ntheir faiths, and that also certainly happens, we expect them not to resort to violence. The same\ngoes for all faiths, including Islam.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nWhen all of us who are people of faith - and I am one \u2014 feel the pain of insults, of\nmisunderstanding, of denigration to what we cherish, we must expect ourselves and others not to\nresort to violence, That is a universal standard and expectation, and it is everyone's obligation to\nmeet that, so that we make no differences, we expect no less of ourselves than we expect of\nothers, You cannot respond to offensive speech with violence without begetting more violence.\nAnd I so strongly believe that the great religions of the world are stronger than any insults. They\nhave withstood offense for centuries. Refraining from violence, then, is not a sign of weakness in\none's faith; it is absolutely the opposite, a sign that one's faith is unshakable.\nSo tonight, we must come together and recommit ourselves to working toward a future marked\nby understanding and acceptance rather than distrust, hatred, and fear. We can pledge that\nwhenever one person speaks out in ignorance and bigotry, ten voices will answer. They will\nanswer resoundingly against the offense and the insult, answering ignorance with enlightenment,\nanswering hatred with understanding, answering darkness with light; that if one person commits\na violent act in the name of religion, millions will stand up and condemn it out of strength.\nIn times like these, it can be easy to despair that some differences are irreconcilable, some\nmountains too steep to climb; we will therefore never reach the level of understanding and\npeacefulness that we seek, and which I believe the great religions of the world call us to pursue.\nBut that's not what I believe, and I don't think it's what you believe either here tonight. Part of\nwhat makes our country so special is we keep trying. We keep working. We keep investing in\nour future. We keep supporting the next generation, believing that young people can keep us\nmoving forward in a positive direction.\nSo tonight I think it's important that we talk not just about that better tomorrow that we all seek,\nbut also about some of the things \u2014 the real, practical, tangible things \u2014 that young people are\ndoing to help shape that better future.\nTwo years ago in this room, at our Eid reception, we launched a program called Generation\nChange to lead a grassroots agenda of positive engagement with Muslim communities. And I\nasked the young Muslim leaders in the audience that night to be our unofficial ambassadors, to\nhelp build personal connections, seek out partners in other countries. And I can report to you\ntonight they did not disappoint. In a few minutes, you're going to meet some of these young\nleaders, each with a powerful story to tell.\nThe Generation Change network that started in this room now circles the globe. We are building\nan international alliance of young people who want to drive change in their own communities.\nThey act as mentors, spark respectful debates, simply offer words of encouragement when\nneeded. But most importantly, they inspire others to keep expanding the circle of mutual\nunderstanding and respect, one person at a time.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Our 2012 Hours Against Hate initiative encourages\nyoung people to put themselves in another person's shoes through service projects. So far, young\npeople from all over the world have pledged thousands of volunteer hours to help people from a\ndifferent background, to see them as a fellow human being, not a stereotype, not a caricature, but\nanother real live person \u2014 people who don't look like you, live like you, pray like you, but with\nwhom we will share this planet. And therefore, we have work to do.\nPeople of faith and conscience are called to be the leaders of tolerance. In my tradition, like all\ntraditions, we are expected to love one another. And together, we have to translate that into better\nunderstanding and cooperation. I'm particularly pleased that the young people you will hear from\ntonight are really setting an example, not only for young people elsewhere in the world but,\nfrankly, for us who are older as well.\nLet me now call to the stage someone who has been a tremendous assistance to me in these\nefforts. Farah Pandith is the Department's first Special Representative to Muslim Communities.\nAnd from the beginning, she has made reaching out to young people and civil society her top\npriority. Farah will introduce you to three young leaders who I am very proud of\nRemarks at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony to Honor Those Lost in Attacks in Benghazi, Libya\nSeptember 14, 2012\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Chaplain. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President,\nSecretary Panetta, Ambassador Rice, Secretary Powell and Mrs. Powell, family members of the\nfour patriots and heroes we bring home, members of the State Department family, ladies and\ngentlemen, today we bring home four Americans who gave their lives for our country and our\nvalues. To the families of our fallen colleagues, I offer our most heartfelt condolences and\ndeepest gratitude.\nSean Smith joined the State Department after six years in the Air Force. He was respected as an\nexpert on technology by colleagues in Pretoria, Baghdad, Montreal, and The Hague. He enrolled\nin correspondence courses at Penn State and had high hopes for the future. Sean leaves behind a\nloving wife Heather, two young children, Samantha and Nathan, and scores of grieving family,\nfriends, and colleagues. And that's just in this world. Because online in the virtual worlds that\nSean helped create, he is also being mourned by countless competitors, collaborators, and garners\nwho shared his passion.\nTyrone Woods, known to most as Rone, spent two decades as a Navy SEAL, serving multiple\ntours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in\ndangerous posts from Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well\nas the arms of a warrior, earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic.

Glen deployed to some of the\nmost dangerous places on Earth, including Iraq and Afghanistan, always putting his life on the\nline to safeguard other Americans. Our thoughts and prayers are with Glen's father Bernard, his\nmother Barbara, his brother Gregory, his sister Kathleen, and their grieving families, friends, and\ncolleagues.\nI was honored to know Ambassador Chris Stevens. I want to thank his parents and siblings, who\nare here today, for sharing Chris with us and with our country. What a wonderful gift you gave\nus. Over his distinguished career in the Foreign Service, Chris won friends for the United States\nin far-flung places. He made those people's hopes his own. During the revolution in Libya, he\nrisked his life to help protect the Libyan people from a tyrant, and he gave his life helping them\nbuild a better country.\nPeople loved to work with Chris. And as he rose through the ranks, they loved to work for Chris.\nHe was known not only for his courage but for his smile \u2014 goofy but contagious \u2014 for his sense\nof fun and that California cool.\nIn the days since the attack, so many Libyans \u2014 including the Ambassador from Libya to the\nUnited States, who is with us today \u2014 have expressed their sorrow and solidarity. One young\nwoman, her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness, held up a handwritten sign that said\n\"Thugs and killers don't represent Benghazi nor Islam,\" The President of the Palestinian\nAuthority, who worked closely with Chris when he served in Jerusalem, sent me a letter\nremembering his energy and integrity, and deploring \u2014 and I quote \u2014 \"an act of ugly terror.\"\nMany others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments.\nThis has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We've seen the\nheavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We've seen rage\nand violence directed at American embassies over an awful interne video that we had nothing to\ndo with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because it is senseless, and it is\ntotally unacceptable.\nThe people of Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the\ntyranny of a mob. Reasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do\neverything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts. And\nwe will, under the President's leadership, keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the\nworld.\nThere will be more difficult days ahead, but it is important that we don't lose sight of the\nfundamental fact that America must keep leading the world. We owe it to those four men to\ncontinue the long, hard work of diplomacy. I am enormously proud of the men and women of the\nState Department.

If the last few days teach us anything, let\nit be this: That this work and the men and women who risk their lives to do it are at the heart of\nwhat makes America great and good.\nSo we will wipe away our tears, stiffen our spines, and face the future undaunted. And we will\ndo it together, protecting and helping one another, just like Sean, Tyrone, Glen, and Chris always\ndid. May God bless them and grant their families peace and solace, and may God continue to\nbless the United States of America.\nAnd now, let me have the great honor of introducing someone who came to the State Department\nearlier this week to grieve with us. He well understands and values the work that these men were\ndoing for our country. The President of the United States.\nRemarks With Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Patricia Espinosa After Their\nMeeting\nSeptember 18, 2012\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it is such a pleasure for me to\nwelcome my friend and colleague, Secretary Espinosa, along with a very distinguished\ndelegation of officials from the Mexican Government for this continuation of consultation at the\nhighest levels of each of our governments.\nBefore I turn to the matters discussed today, let me give a brief update on the ongoing U.S.\nresponse to the protests in the Middle East and elsewhere. I'm sure as you know already, we are\ntaking aggressive steps to protect our staffs in embassies and consulates worldwide. That\nincludes reviewing our security posture at every post and augmenting it where necessary. And\nwe are working closely with the Libyan Government in our efforts to bring to justice those who\nmurdered our four American colleagues in Benghazi.\nThe FBI is now in Tripoli to join the investigation with Libyan officials, and there is nothing\nmore important to us than ensuring the safety of our American representatives worldwide. At the\nsame time, as I have said to State Department employees, the incidents of the past week highlight\nhow important our work is. The United States must and will remain strongly engaged in the\nworld. Our men and women risk their lives in service to our country and our values, because they\nknow that the United States must be a force for peace and progress. That is worth striving and\nsacrificing for, and nothing that happened last week changes this fundamental fact.\nNow, turning to our friends and partners in Mexico, we are always pleased to have a chance to\ndiscuss matters of mutual interest and concern between us. Mexico is one of our closest friends\nas well as partner on dozens of critical issues. So we talk about every kind of issue you can\nimagine, from education and healthcare to poverty alleviation to the environment. But today, we\nfocused on a top priority for us both a security.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

And I want to offer\nmy personal appreciation to President Calderon and to Foreign Secretary Espinosa for their\nleadership and commitment to this partnership and to all on both sides of the border in our\ngovernments who have been deeply engaged and committed to it. The Merida Initiative\nrepresents an unprecedented level of security cooperation between Mexico and the United States.\nAs our countries continue to deal with the serious challenge of transnational criminal\norganizations, including drug traffickers, illegal arms traffickers, money launderers, and violent\ngangs that threaten people on both sides of the border, we well know there is no quick and easy\nway to stop these criminals and bring them to justice. But nevertheless, during the past now\nnearly four years, our countries have collaborated to an extraordinary and unprecedented degree.\nWe have brought together policy makers and experts from across our governments and societies\nwho have worked hand in hand to keep our people safe. And I think the habits of cooperation we\nhave built are among our most important achievements, and we will rely on them for a long time\nto come.\nToday, our delegations reviewed the gains we've made on key priorities, including improving\nlaw enforcement coordination, reducing the demand for drugs, modernizing our border\ninfrastructure, strengthening the rule of law, and building more resilient and empowered\ncommunities. We also discussed the lessons we've learned and the work that lies ahead in these\nand other areas, which our joint statement will reflect. I want to underscore how important our\nsecurity relationship with Mexico is to the United States.\nThe Government of Mexico and the Mexican people have faced the threat posed by these\ncriminals with courage and resolve, and we remain committed to doing everything we can to\nsupport Mexico as it continues to work to bring those criminals to justice. This is a transnational\nproblem, and it calls for a transnational solution, and the United States believes this is a matter of\nshared responsibility. That was the first message I brought as Secretary of State when I came to\nMexico, and it continues to be the hallmark of our efforts together. Making sure our people are\nsafe and our neighbors are safe is of the utmost importance to us.\nNow, our two countries share many other priorities, and one of them, empowering women and\ngirls, was also addressed today. We took the opportunity, the Foreign Secretary and I, to sign a\nMemorandum of Understanding between our countries to work together to advance gender\nequality, empower girls and women, promote their human rights, and enhance their security.\nSo again, Secretary Espinosa, let me thank you for years of work and effort, for our productive\nconversations in many places around the world and again today, and for being such a valuable\ncolleague and partner. The United States deeply, deeply values our relationship with Mexico and\nthe ties of family and friendship that connect so many millions of our people.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

So thank you very much.\nMS. NULAND: We'll take (inaudible). Margaret Brennan, CBS News.\nQUESTION: Madam Secretary, thanks for your time. Are you any closer to finding who killed\nAmbassador Chris Stevens?, Libya's President says this attack was planned for months. Are you\nconfident he's wrong and that security measures were appropriate? And will you leave justice to\nthe Libyans?\nSECRETARY CLINTON: As I said at the outset, we are taking aggressive steps to protect our\npeople and our consulates and embassies around the world. We are reviewing our security\nposture at every post and working with host governments to be sure they know what our security-\nneeds are wherever necessary. We are also working closely with the Libyan Government to bring\nthe perpetrators to justice so that we can be assured that we have found who murdered our four,\ncolleagues and under what circumstances. As I said, the FBI has joined the investigation inside\nLibya, and we will not rest until the people who orchestrated this attack are found and punished.\nIt is also important to look at this strategically and understand what is going on across the region.\nIn a number of places where protests have tuned violent, we are seeing the hand of extremists\nwho are trying to exploit people's inflamed passions for their own agendas. But overwhelmingly,\nwe have found that the people of Egypt, of Libya, of Yemen and Tunisia are not prepared to\ntrade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob. They want to turn their attention to the\nfuture to provide better opportunities for themselves and their children, and they want a strong\npartnership with the United States and the American people based on mutual interests and mutual\nrespect.\nThis is part of a larger debate that is going on inside these societies. In Libya, for example, in\ntheir first free elections, moderates were successful at the polls. But look, there are extremists in\nall of these societies and on the outside who are working to take advantage of broad outrage in\norder to incite violence and specifically incite violence against Americans and American\nfacilities.\nAnd as I have said to many of the leaders I have spoken to over the past week, these extremist\nefforts are a threat to the people of the societies and the governments of those societies as well as\nto the region and the United States. And I think it's important at this moment for leaders to put\nthemselves on the right side of this debate - to speak out clearly and unequivocally against\nviolence, whoever incites it or conducts it\nAnd in a struggle like this, there can be no doubt where the United States must stand. We support\nthose who are fighting for the same values and rights that we believe in - in democracy, in\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

And I want to\nunderscore that the United States will continue to work with partners and allies in the region and\naround the world to help bring security to these nations so that the promise of the revolutions that\nthey experienced can be realized.\nAnd finally, on your specific point about Benghazi, we obviously never talk publicly about\nsecurity at any of our missions for obvious reasons. But that said, let me assure you that our\nsecurity in Benghazi included a unit of host government security forces, as well as a local guard\nforce of the kind that we rely on in many places around the world. In addition to the security\noutside the compound, we relied on a wall and a robust security presence inside the compound.\nAnd with all of our missions overseas, in advance of September lid', as is done every year, we\ndid an evaluation on threat streams. And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has\nsaid we had no actionable intelligence that an attack on our post in Benghazi was planned or\nimminent.\nBut let me state the obvious again. Our diplomats engage in dangerous work, and it's the nature\nof diplomacy in fragile societies and conflict zones to be aware of the necessity for security but\nto also continue the important diplomatic work that has to go on. There is risk inherent in what\nwe do and what these brave men and women representing the United States are up against every\nsingle day, and we do our very best to limit that risk by ensuring that our security protocols\nreflect the environments in which diplomats work and the threats that they are presented with.\nThank you.\nRemarks With Indonesian Foreign Minister Raden Mohammad Marty Muliana\nNatalegawa After Their Meeting\nSeptember 20, 2012\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it's such a pleasure, as always, to\nwelcome the Indonesian Foreign Minister, and I believe the largest delegation that has ever come\nfrom Indonesia, for the purpose of our third meeting of the U.S.-Indonesia Joint Commission.\nThis commission is the result of a vision by our two presidents for a comprehensive partnership,\nand the agreement to that effect was signed in 2010. Thanks to this partnership, the United States\nand Indonesia are working more closely than ever on a range of issues from global security to\nclean energy and climate to regional trade and commerce.\nAnd today, Marty and I had the chance to take stock of where our teams have come in the time\nof the last year, because we liad our meeting in Bali a year ago. And I must say, I was very\nimpressed. We covered a great deal today.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nBut before I start, I'd like to say a few words about the protests in several countries around the\nworld. We have condemned in the strongest possible terms the violence that has erupted from\nthese protests. And as I have said, the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and\nreprehensible, and the United States Government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it.\nBut there is no justification for violence, and I want to thank the Foreign Minister and his\ngovernment for speaking out against violence. We have to look to reasonable people and\nresponsible leaders everywhere to stand up to extremists who would seek to take advantage of\nthis moment to commit violent acts against embassies and their fellow countrymen.\nToday's meetings have highlighted the strong foundation that we have built together. And one of\nour most important concerns is promoting peace and stability in the Asia Pacific. Today, I'm\nannouncing that the Obama Administration has informed Congress of the potential sale of eight\nAH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters to the Indonesian Government. This agreement will\nstrengthen our comprehensive partnership and help enhance security across the region.\nOn growth and prosperity, we are increasing our trade relationship that topped $26 billion last\nyear. Investments in transportation, energy, and infrastructure are creating jobs and supporting\neconomic growth in both countries. For example, the deal between Lion Air and Boeing alone\nrepresents $21 billion in trade over the next decade. Indonesia's Government has announced half\na trillion dollars in infrastructure improvements, and we recently signed a memorandum of\nunderstanding to make it easier for American companies to bid on these projects.\nAnd yesterday, we signed an agreement for implementing our Millennium Challenge\nCorporation Compact with Indonesia. Over the next five years, the United States will invest $600\nmillion in clean energy development, child health and nutrition programs, and efforts to help\nmake Indonesia's Government more transparent and open.\nThe United States is also looking forward to Indonesia hosting APEC in 2013, and we are\nconfident that Indonesia will come to this role with a commitment to promote greater economic\nintegration across the Asia Pacific.\nBoth the Foreign Minister and I believe that strong education is essential to compete in a modem\nglobal economy. That's why the United States has expanded the Fulbright Program and\nsupported partnerships between dozens of American and Indonesian universities. Academic\nexchanges between our countries are up and applications from Indonesian students to visit the\nUnited States have increased by one third. USAID has recently expanded its basic education\nprogram to provide $83 million for teacher training and literacy programs for young children.\nAnd we're providing $20 in scholarship funding for Indonesian graduate students.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

The Foreign Minister's\npersonal leadership has helped lay the groundwork for diplomacy between ASEAN and China as\nit relates to the South China Sea. And we continue to support ASEAN's six-point principles,\nwhich we believe will help reduce tensions and pave the way for a comprehensive code of\nconduct for addressing disputes without threats, coercion, or use of force.\nFinally. Indonesia and the United States have stood together on a range of global challenges,\nfrom democratic reform in Burma to combating climate change, to working to end the violence\nin Syria. We are also coordinating efforts to further develop south-south and triangular\ncooperation, such as enhancing disaster preparedness in Burma and convening a conference on\nwomen's empowerment.\nWe believe that as the second and third-largest democracies in the world, the United States and\nIndonesia have a special responsibility to promote democracy and human rights. And for the last\nfour years, Indonesia has hosted the Bali Democracy Forum to promote peaceful, democratic\ntransitions through example and open dialogue. Last year, more than 80 countries attended. And\nonce again, the United States will be sending a high-level delegation.\nSo, Minister, thank you for everything. Thank you for the great partnership we've had between\nus and between our countries.\nMS. NULAND: We'll take two questions today, we'll start with Ros Jordan of Al Jazeera\nEnglish.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Madam Secretary, Mr. Foreign Minister. Madam Secretary, my\nquestion is about the ongoing investigation into last week's attack at the consulate in Benghazi.\nYou are meeting this afternoon with members of Congress to discuss the progress and the\nconcerns that they understandably have. First, there is the federal mandate to establish an\naccountability review board. Have you done so? Who would you like to see chair it? Are there\ncertain questions that you desperately want to have answered in order to safeguard the safety of\nForeign Service Officers around the world?\nAnd related to this, given the political instability and the successes of the past year and a half, are\nyou satisfied that in light of those political changes, enough was done to protect those working in\nthe Middle East and North Africa? And then finally \u2014 and this is perhaps going into the area of\nrumor and speculation \u2014 but there is at least one report suggesting that Ambassador Stevens felt\nthat he was on a, quote, \"al-Qaida hit list\" Is this a scurrilous rumor? Is this gallows humor\nwhen one is working in a period of difficulty and great challenge, or is there something more to\nwhat he allegedly \u2014 and I stress that word \u2014 said?\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Well, first, let me say I'm looking forward to the opportunity to go\nup to the Congress today. I will be briefing in two separate sessions, the House and the Senate, in\na classified setting, along with my interagency colleagues, as we continue to work together, and\nwith governments around the world, to ensure that our people and our facilities are safe. I will be\njoined today by the Director of National Intelligence, General Clapper, by the Deputy Secretary\nof Defense, Ash Carter, by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Sandy Winnefeld,\nalong with experts from the FBI, the State Department, and elsewhere in the government.\nNow, I anticipate that this briefing will cover our security posture before and during the events,\nand the steps we have taken since to do everything we can with host governments to protect our\npeople and our embassies and consulates. The Director of National Intelligence will speak to the\nintelligence issues surrounding these events in Libya. Deputy Secretary Carter will brief on the\nsuperb support we have had from the U.S. military in the wake of these events, and we are at the\nvery early stages of an FBI investigation. The team from the FBI reached Libya earlier this week.\nAnd I will advise Congress also that I am launching an accountability review board that will be\nchaired by Ambassador Thomas Pickering.\nI will also talk about the importance of the broader relationships with these countries in light of\nthe events of the past days. There are obviously very real challenges in these new democracies,\nthese fragile societies, but as I said last week, the vast majority of the people in these countries\ndid not throw off the tyranny of a dictator to trade it for the tyranny of a mob. And we are\nconcerned first and foremost with our own people and facilities, but we are concerned about the\ninternal security in these countries because ultimately, that puts at risk the men, women, and\nchildren of these societies on a daily ongoing basis if actions are not taken to try to restore\nsecurity and civil order.\nAnd let me just conclude by saying that there can be no doubt where the United States stands.\nWe continue to support those who are fighting for universal values \u2014 values that we see at work\nin Indonesia \u2014 the third largest democracy in the world. We believe that these values of universal\nrights, of justice and accountability, of democracy, are there for every person regardless of where\nthat person might live. So I will look forward to having a chance to talk with members of\nCongress.\nAs to your final question, I have absolutely no information or reason to believe that there's any\nbasis for that.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMS. NULAND: Last question. Victoria Sidjabat from Tempo Magazine, please.\nQUESTION: Yes. Madam, thank you. My question is: Starting today, U.S. Embassy and\nConsulate are closed in Indonesia as the Muslim movie become wild fireball, which could be\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

If it's continuing happen, it's \u2014\nobviously could give impact to the implementation of (inaudible) program in Indonesia. What is\nthe reason U.S. Government closed the Embassy and Consulate in Indonesia? What is your\nexpectation from Indonesia Government, for my Minister Marty Natalegawa? How Indonesia\nGovernment respond to the closing of this Embassy and Consulate, it's starting today? Is U.S. \u2014\nIndonesia Government has capability to protect U.S. Embassy and Consulate. So the (inaudible)\nprogram implemented \u2014 could be implemented successfully in Indonesia. Thank you.\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Well, let me begin by saying how grateful we are for the excellent\ncooperation we have received from the Government of Indonesia, and in particular, from the law\nenforcement and security institutions in Indonesia. We are very grateful for not only the\ncooperation and protection that has been provided to our facilities, but also to the strong\nstatements condemning violence from the President, the Foreign Mihister, and others.\nIn consultation with the Government of Indonesia, we have temporarily, for tomorrow, closed\nour facilities. We want to be sure that law enforcement in Indonesia has the ability to do what it\nneeds to do to make sure that there is no disruption of civil order and security. So we are\ncooperating completely, and we're very grateful for the strong leadership provided by Indonesia.\nFOREIGN MINISTER NATALEGAWA: Hello, (inaudible), if I may just also respond.\nPrecisely as the Secretary had said, the decision by the United States Government to close\ntemporarily its embassies and consulates tomorrow in Indonesia is a decision that's been made\nbased on communication and conversation between the authorities in Indonesia and the United\nStates as well. So in other words, it is an informed decision, a decision that is not intended to\nshow any unfriendly intent on the part of anyone, but it is what it is, and it's quite some \u2014 it's the\nkind of step that governments actually carry out when situations requires it, even in our case.\nSome of our embassies abroad, when the situation requires us to have a temporary closing of the\nembassy, we do that as well. So it is something that is quite regular and something that is\nactually coordinated as well.\nBut if I may just broaden the subject matter, I think as our President had said in the past,\nIndonesian Government the Indonesian people, even, obviously cannot and would not condone\nthe \u2014 any acts of violence against diplomatic premises, against diplomatic personnel, because\nthat is, truly \u2014 would be a challenge to the efficient and a proper conduct of relations among\nstates. So that's our point of departure.\nAt the same time, of course, beyond the immediate issue of protection of the embassies, we have\nstill ahead of us the challenge of how to prevent the kind of situations where we are now at in\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

We've had the opportunity to meet in Islamabad and other\nsettings, but I am very pleased that we would have this chance to exchange views on our bilateral\nrelationship as well as regional and global issues.\nI want to begin by addressing the events of the day and the past week. Today, we've once again\nseen protests in several cities in Pakistan. Unfortunately, some of those protests have turned\nviolent and, sadly, resulted in loss of life. I want to thank the Government of Pakistan for their\nefforts to protect our Embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Lahore, Peshawar, and Karachi.\nAnd I want to be clear, as I have said on numerous occasions, the violence we have seen cannot\nbe tolerated. There is no justification for violence. Of course, there is provocation, and we have\ncertainly made clear that we do not in any way support provocation. We found the video that's at\nthe core of this series of events offensive, disgusting, reprehensible.\nBut that does not provide justification for violence, and therefore it is important for responsible\nleaders, indeed responsible people everywhere, to stand up and speak out against violence and\nparticularly against those who would exploit this difficult moment to advance their own\nextremist ideologies.\nYesterday afternoon when I briefed the Congress, I made it clear that keeping our people\neverywhere in the world safe is our top priority. What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist\nattack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who\nmurdered four Americans. And we are taking aggressive measures at all of our posts to protect\nour staffs and their families along with locally employed people who provide so many important\ncontributions to the work of our missions.\nThe Foreign Minister and I will have a chance to cover a full range of subjects today, and it is no\nsecret that the past year and a half has been challenging for Pakistan and the United States. And\nwe still have work to do to get our bilateral relationship to the point where we would like it to be,\nbut we both recognize that we can achieve more when we work together on a focused agenda.

I look forward to seeing President Zardari next week\nat the UN General Assembly. At each meeting, we are working to identify the strategic goals we\nshare \u2014 and there are many \u2014 and the concrete actions we can each take to accomplish them.\nOur number one shared priority remains pursuing our joint counterterrorism objectives to ensure\nthe security of American and Pakistani citizens alike. We face a common threat from a common\nenemy, and we must confront terrorism and extremism together. Earlier this month, I designated\nthe Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization so we could make full use of every\navailable legal authority to end their deadly attacks. Pakistan's parliament has called for\nexpelling foreign fighters so that Pakistan's territory can be fully under control of the Pakistani\nGovernment and cannot be used to launch attacks against other nations.\nAnd the follow-through on this is challenging but necessary, and we look forward to working\nwith Pakistan as they continue to address these problems. We have both pledged to support a\nsecure, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan, which is vital for the security of the region. And I\nwant to thank Foreign Minister Khar for Pakistan's reopening of the NATO supply lines to allow\nthe movement of goods to Afghanistan.\nWe will discuss the successful first meeting of the Safe Passage Working Group in Islamabad\nwhich brought together Afghan, Pakistani, and U.S. representatives to advance the peace process\nin Afghanistan. The Pakistani Government's public call for insurgents to come forward and talk\nwith the Afghan Government was particularly important. We are ready to work together to build\non these steps, and we will continue our discussions through bilateral consultations and the U.S.-\nAfghanistan-Pakistan Core Group.\nNow, of course, our relationship goes far beyond our shared security concerns, and today we will\ndiscuss the many other ways in which we work together, particularly to create economic\nopportunity for Pakistanis. Foreign Minister Khar and I agree that we need to shift our economic\nrelationship from aid to trade and investment. We are working to help Pakistan attract more\nprivate sector investment. We hope to finalize a bilateral investment treaty soon. And we've\ncreated a Pakistan private investment initiative to help more of Pakistan's small and medium\nsized companies get access to capital.\nOver the past few years, we have seen Pakistan's civilian government begin to put down stronger\nroots. And if elections proceed as planned next year, it will mark the first time in Pakistan's\nhistory that a civilian-led government has served its full term. The United States supports\nPakistan's economic development, and we have said many times that we want to see democracy\nsucceed in Pakistan.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

I am pleased to welcome the Foreign Minister from\nTunisia I'm looking forward to our meeting, We obviously have a great deal to discuss, and I\nwant to thank the Foreign Minister and the Government of Tunisia for their efforts over the last\nweek to help secure our Embassy and the American Cooperative School of Tunis following the\nviolent assaults of last Friday.\nWe are monitoring events closely today. There is no higher priority for President Obama and\nmyself than the safety of our people. We've taken a number of steps around the world to\naugment security and to protect our personnel at diplomatic posts. And we are working closely\nwith host governments in this effort.\nAs I have said before and as is embodied in the Vienna Convention and other international\nagreements, all governments have the duty, the solemn duty, to defend diplomatic missions.\nThey must be safe and protected places so that governments can exchange views and work on\nmany important issues, and leaders across the world must stand up and be counted in rejecting\nviolence and holding violent actors accountable.\nWe are working closely with the Government of Tunisia They have assisted us in enhancing the\nsecurity of our facilities. We've also discussed with them the imperative of bringing to justice\nthose responsible for these violent attacks. And we have offered and will continue to look for\nways that we can assist the new Government of Tunisia in ensuring the rule of law throughout\ntheir country, first and foremost for the people of Tunisia themselves. We look forward to\ncontinuing to build our hew partnership with the Tunisian Government and people. Our\nrelationship is built around the shared principles of all democracies \u2014 a commitment to\nnonviolence, to tolerance, and inclusivity for all people, and to upholding the rule of law.\nThe Tunisian people have bravely put themselves on the road to democracy. They were the first\nof the Arab revolutions and they have made important progress in a very short period of time.\nThey have worked too hard and sacrificed too much over too many years to see their progress\nhijacked at derailed by extremists with Ulric own a5,-.\n,\n,encia.

Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens\nand Foreign Service Information Management Officer, Sean Smith. We are still making next of\nkin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all their families and\ncolleagues.\nA 21 year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he\nsustained in the attack on our office in Benghazi.\nI had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke\neloquently about his passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This\nassignment was only the latest in his more than two decades of dedication to advancing closer\nties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a Peace Corps\nVolunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans\non the ground in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to\nbuild the foundation for a new, free nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work\nthat he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's values and interests, even when\nthat meant putting himself in danger.\nSean Smith was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten years ago.

Heavily armed militants\nassaulted the compound and set fire to our buildings. American and Libyan security personnel\nbattled the attackers together. Four Americans were killed. They included Sean Smith, a Foreign\nService information management officer, and our Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. We are\nstill making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals.\nThis is an attack that should shock the conscience of people of all faiths around the world. We\ncondemn in the strongest terms this senseless act of violence, and we send our prayers to the\nfamilies, friends, and colleagues of those we've lost.\nAll over the world, every day, America's diplomats and development experts risk their lives in\nthe service of our country and our values, because they believe that the United States must be a\nforce for peace and progress in the world, that these aspirations are worth striving and sacrificing\nfor. Alongside our men and women in uniform, they represent the best traditions of a bold and\ngenerous nation.\nIn the lobby of this building, the State Department, the names of those who have fallen in the line\nof duty are inscribed in marble.

He joined the Foreign Service, learned languages, won friends for America\nin distant places, and made other people's hopes his own.\nIn the early days of the Libyan revolution, I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition.\nHe arrived on a cargo ship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships with\nLibya's revolutionaries. He risked his life to stop a tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a\nbetter Libya. The world needs more Chris Stevenses.

He spent 10 years as an information management officer\nin the State Department, he was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary\nassignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather, with whom I spoke this morning. He was a\nfather to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being proud of the\nservice their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and\nfinally to Benghazi.\nThe mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary,\nand we and the people of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy.\nToday, many Americans are asking \u2014 indeed, I asked myself\u2014 how could this happen? How\ncould this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from destruction?\nThis question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be.\nBut we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group \u2014\nnot the people or Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a\ncountry scarred by war and tyranny, they were hailed as friends and partners. And when the\nattack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post. Some were wounded.\nLibyans carried Chris' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to\nsafety. And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the\nviolence and pledged every effort to protect our people and pursue those responsible.\nThe friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty\nof this attack. A free and stable Libya is still in America's interest and security, and we will not\nturn our back on that, nor will we rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and\nbrought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities to move swiftly and\nsurely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American\nembassies, consulates, and citizens.\nThere will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher\npriority than protecting our men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine\nthe precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault. Some have sought to\njustify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our Embassy in Cairo\nyesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the intemet. America's commitment\nto religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear \u2014 there is\nno justification for this, none. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long\nas there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a\ntrue and lasting peace.\nIt is especially difficult that this happened on September I I th. It's an anniversary that means a\ngreat deal to all Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet\nfinished, that the job of putting an end to violent extremism and building a safe and stable world\ncontinues.

Doherty in Benghazi, Libya\nSeptember 13, 2012\nThe attack on our diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya on Tuesday claimed the lives of four\nAmericans. Yesterday, I spoke about two: Ambassador Chris Stevens and Information\nManagement Officer Sean Smith. Today, we also recognize the two security personnel who died\nhelping protect their colleagues. Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty were both decorated\nmilitary veterans who served our country with honor and distinction. Our thoughts, prayers, and\ndeepest gratitude are with their families and friends. Our embassies could not carry on our\ncritical work around the world without the service and sacrifice of brave people like Tyrone and\nGlen.\nTyrone's friends and colleagues called him \"Rone,\" and they relied on his courage and skill,\nhoned over two decades as a Navy SEAL. In uniform, he served multiple tours in Iraq and\nAfghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in dangerous posts from\nCentral America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well as the arm of a warrior,\nearning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. All our hearts go out to\nTyrone's wife Dorothy and his three sons, Tyrone Jr., Hunter, and Kai, who was born just a few\nmonths ago.\nWe also grieve for Glen Doherty, called Bub, and his family: his father Bernard, his mother\nBarbara, his brother Gregory, and his sister Kathleen. Glen was also a former Navy SEAL and an\nexperienced paramedic. And he put his life on the line many times, protecting Americans in Iraq,\nAfghanistan, and other hotspots. In the end, he died the way he lived \u2014 with selfless honor and\nunstinting valor.\nWe condemn the attack that took the lives of these heroes in the strongest terms, and we are\ntaking additional steps to safeguard American embassies, consulates, and citizens around the\nworld. This violence should shock the conscience of people of all faiths and traditions. We\nappreciate the statements of support that have poured in from across the region and beyond.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Well, let me welcome our friends and colleagues\nfrom Morocco here to the Benjamin Franklin Room on the eighth floor of the State Department\nfor this very important first session of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue. Before I begin to\naddress the significance of this Strategic Dialogue and the next step in our long relations with\nMorocco, I want to say a few words about the events unfolding in the world today.\nWe are closely watching what is happening in Yemen and elsewhere, and we certainly hope and\nexpect that there will be steps taken to avoid violence and prevent the escalation of protests into\nviolence.\nI also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to these\nprotests in a number of countries. Let me state very clearly \u2014 and I hope it is obvious \u2014 that the\nUnited States Government had absolutely nothing to do with this video. We absolutely reject its\ncontent and message. America's commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very\nbeginning of our nation. And as you know, we are home to people of all religions, many of\nwhom came to this country seeking the right to exercise their own religion, including, of course,\nmillions of Muslims. And we have the greatest respect for people of faith.\nTo us, to me personally, this video is disgusting and reprehensible. It appears to have a deeply\ncynical purpose: to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage. But as I said yesterday, there\nis no justification, none at all, for responding to this video with violence, We condemn the\nviolence that has resulted in the strongest terms, and we greatly appreciate that many Muslims in\nthe United States and around the world have spoken out on this issue.\nViolence, we believe, has no place in religion and is no way to honor religion. Islam, like other\nreligions, respects the fundamental dignity of human beings, and it is a violation of that\nfundamental dignity to wage attacks on innocents. As long as there are those who are willing to\nshed blood and take innocent life in the name of religion, the name of God, the world will never\nknow a true and lasting peace. It is especially wrong for violence to be directed against\ndiplomatic missions. These are places whose very purpose is peaceful: to promote better\nunderstuiding across countries and cultures. All governments have a responsibility to protect\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Now, I would\nnote that in today's world with today's technologies, that is impossible. But even if it were\npossible, our country does have a long tradition of free expression which is enshrined in our\nConstitution and our law, and we do not stop individual citizens from expressing their views no\nmatter how distasteful they may be.\nThere are, of course, different views around the world about the outer limits of free speech and\nfree expression, but there should be no debate about the simple proposition that violence in\nresponse to speech is not acceptable. We all \u2014 whether we are leaders in government, leaders in\ncivil society or religious leaders \u2014 must draw the line at violence. And any responsible leader\nshould be standing up now and drawing that line.\nI wanted to begin with this statement, because, as our Moroccan friends and all of you know, this\nhas been a difficult week at the State Department. I very much appreciate, Minister, the\ncondolences your government expressed to our Embassy in Rabat And even though that tragedy\nhappened far away in Benghazi, we found a reminder of the deep bounds that connect Morocco\nto the United States. It was in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco that one of the Americans\nwe lost this week, Ambassador Chris Stevens, fell in love with the region when he served as a\nPeace Corps volunteer there. That experience set him on a decades-long career of service. So in\nthe memory of fallen friends and colleagues, let us remind ourselves of the many ways in which\nriot just our governments but the people of our two nations have worked together to build a better\nfuture.\nIn many ways, the United States looks to Morocco to be a leader and a model. His Majesty King\nMohammed deserves great credit for the work you've undertaken. In fact, after my visit to Rabat\nearlier this year. I told my team: \"We need to start a Strategic Dialogue with Morocco.\" No\ncountry has been a friend of the United States longer than Morocco. You were the first nation to\nrecognize us back in 1777. But we're not satisfied with simply having a friendship that is\nlongstanding We want one that is dynamic, growing, looking toward the future. So let me\nhighlight a few of the areas we should focus on today.\nOn political reform, we have all seen remarkable changes taking place across North Africa and\nthe Middle East. I commend Morocco and your government for your efforts to stay ahead of\nthese changes by holding free and fair elections, empowering the elected parliament, taking other\nsteps to ensure that the government reflects the will of the people. Today, our political working\ngroup will discuss how the United States can continue to support your efforts to translate\ncommitments into actions. Because as we all know, democracy, real reform, require that people\nthemselves feel the changes in their evetyday lives: the courts reformed, the government more\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nopen and transparent, universal human rights of all Moroccans \u2014 men and women alike \u2014\nrespected.\nI'm especially pleased by Morocco's commitments to take on the deeply troubling problem of\nchild marriage. We know that child brides are less likely to get an education, more likely to face\nlife-threatening problems, particularly around child birth and delivery, which not only\nshortchanges them but can even rob them and their communities of their lives and talents. So we\nwant to encourage the government and civil society to continue their important work together on\nthis issue.\nWith regard to the Western Sahara, the United States continues to support efforts to find a\npeaceful, sustainable, mutually agreed-upon solution. U.S. policy toward the Western Sahara has\nremained consistent for many years. We have made clear that Morocco's autonomy plan is\nserious, realistic, and credible, and that it represents a potential approach that could satisfy the\naspirations of the people in the Western Sahara to run their own affairs in peace and dignity. We\ncontinue to support the negotiations carried out by the United Nations and hope parties can work\ntoward resolution.\nWith respect to the economy, our second working group will focus on what more can be done to\ndeliver tangible economic benefits. Morocco's economy is relatively healthy, but you face the\nsame problem that is now endemic across the world \u2014 unemployment is still too high, especially\namong young people.\nThat's why the United States is providing $1.5 million to support an effort to attract foreign\ninvestors, foster local economic development, and combat corruption across the region. And I'm\npleased to announce that later this year we will hold a Morocco business development\nconference here in Washington to connect businesses from both countries.\nToday, we should discuss ways to build on all of these efforts by increasing bilateral trade, a\nparticular goal of mine since so much trade from Morocco goes to Europe. I'd like to increase\nthe amount of trade coming to the United States, and also to improve economic integration\nacross North Africa, which could greatly benefit Morocco because of Morocco's stability and\nMorocco's very strong economic foundation. The greater integration there is, the greater the\nbenefits for Moroccans.\nThird, the attack in Benghazi this week reminds us that security remains a vital issue. Through\nour work together on the Global Counterterrorism Task Force, the United States and Morocco\nalready share crucial information and best practices, and I thank Morocco for hosting a Global\nCounterterrorism Task Force workshop on threats in the South Atlantic next month.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

And let me add, the United States greatly\nappreciates the constructive role Morocco is playing on the UN Security Council, especially your\nsupport for the effort to end the violence and bloodshed in Syria and help to usher in a new\ndemocratic future for that country. I commend Morocco for offering to host the next ministerial\nmeeting of the Friends of the Syrian People, and we look forward to continuing to work closely\ntogether as close partners even after your term on the Security Council has ended.\nFinally, our education and cultural ties are reason for much celebration. This year marks the 30th\nanniversary of our official program to facilitate academic exchanges and other bonds between us.\nThere are more than 5,000 Moroccan alumni of these programs. Two are with us today \u2014 Dr.\nBenjelloun and Dr. Ouaouicha \u2014 and we thank them. But among all our work on this front, from\npreserving Morocco's historic sites to empowering youth, there's one area I particularly hope we\ncan focus on today and receive your advice and counsel \u2014 namely, interfaith dialogue.\nIn these tense and turbulent times, it's more important than ever for people of different faiths to\nexchange ideas, to build understanding, to promote religious tolerance. It's one of the great\nchallenges of the 21st century, and it's one that we must address together.\nSo we have a lot of work to do, Minister, but our friendship runs long and deep, and as the treaty\nour nations signed in 1786 says, and I quote, \"Trusting in God, it will remain permanent.\" I'm\nconfident that we will continue to solve problems and produce results that make our nations\nstronger, more peaceful, more secure, more prosperous, and also contribute to doing the same for\nthe world.\nSo again, let me welcome you, Minister. It's been a great pleasure for me to get to know you, to\nwork with you, to be your colleague bilaterally, regionally, and globally, and also welcome your\ndistinguished delegation.\nThank you. (Applause.)\nRemarks at Reception Ntlarking Eid ul-Fitr\nSeptember 13, 2012\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Good evening, and although I am many weeks overdue in saying it:\nEid Mubarak. No matter how belated we are honoring Eid and the end of Ramadan, this is a\ncherished tradition here at the State Department. And I would like to thank all of you for being\nhere, including the many members of the Diplomatic Corps.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nTonight, our gathering is more somber than any of us would like. This comes during sad and\ndifficult days for the State Department family. We lost four Americans. They were good and\nbrave men. They were committed to the cause of building a brighter future for the people of\nLibya. And we condemn the violence in the strongest terms, the violence against our posts in\nBenghazi, in Egypt, and now in Yemen.\nThe Libyan ambassador is with us tonight, and I want to take a moment to thank him for the\nsupport that his government and the Libyan people have shown to the United States in this\ntragedy, particularly the outpouring of feelings of grief and loss because of the killing of our\nambassador.\nAmbassador Aujali, would you mind saying a few words?\nAMBASSADOR AMU: [redacted]\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Ambassador. I know that that was a very\npersonal loss for you, as it was for me. I'm the one who sent Chris to Benghazi during the\nrevolution to show support and be able to advise our government about what we could do to\nbring freedom and democracy and opportunity to the people of Libya.\nReligious freedom and religious tolerance are essential to the stability of any nation, any people.\nHatred and violence in the name of religion only poison the well. All people of faith and good\nwill know that the actions of a small and savage group in Benghazi do not honor religion or God\nin any way. Nor do they speak for the more than one billion Muslims around the world, many of\nwhom have shown an outpouring of support during this time\nUnfortunately, however, over the last 24 hours, we have also seen violence spread elsewhere.\nSome seek to justify this behavior as a response to inflammatory, despicable material posted on\nthe intemet. As I said earlier today, the United States rejects both the content and the message of\nthat video. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of\nothers. At our meeting earlier today, my colleague, the foreign minister of Morocco, said that all\nprophets should be respected because they are all symbols of our humanity, for all humanity.\nBut both of us were crystal clear in this paramount message: There is never any justification for\nviolent acts of this kind. And we look to leaders around the world to stand up and speak out\nagainst violence, and to take steps to protect diplomatic missions from attack.\nThink about it. When Christians are subject to insults to their faith, and that certainly happens,\nwe expect them not to resort to violence. When Hindus or Buddhists are subjected to insults to\ntheir faiths, and that also certainly happens, we expect them not to resort to violence. The same\ngoes for all faiths, including Islam.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nWhen all of us who are people of faith - and I am one \u2014 feel the pain of insults, of\nmisunderstanding, of denigration to what we cherish, we must expect ourselves and others not to\nresort to violence, That is a universal standard and expectation, and it is everyone's obligation to\nmeet that, so that we make no differences, we expect no less of ourselves than we expect of\nothers, You cannot respond to offensive speech with violence without begetting more violence.\nAnd I so strongly believe that the great religions of the world are stronger than any insults. They\nhave withstood offense for centuries. Refraining from violence, then, is not a sign of weakness in\none's faith; it is absolutely the opposite, a sign that one's faith is unshakable.\nSo tonight, we must come together and recommit ourselves to working toward a future marked\nby understanding and acceptance rather than distrust, hatred, and fear. We can pledge that\nwhenever one person speaks out in ignorance and bigotry, ten voices will answer. They will\nanswer resoundingly against the offense and the insult, answering ignorance with enlightenment,\nanswering hatred with understanding, answering darkness with light; that if one person commits\na violent act in the name of religion, millions will stand up and condemn it out of strength.\nIn times like these, it can be easy to despair that some differences are irreconcilable, some\nmountains too steep to climb; we will therefore never reach the level of understanding and\npeacefulness that we seek, and which I believe the great religions of the world call us to pursue.\nBut that's not what I believe, and I don't think it's what you believe either here tonight. Part of\nwhat makes our country so special is we keep trying. We keep working. We keep investing in\nour future. We keep supporting the next generation, believing that young people can keep us\nmoving forward in a positive direction.\nSo tonight I think it's important that we talk not just about that better tomorrow that we all seek,\nbut also about some of the things \u2014 the real, practical, tangible things \u2014 that young people are\ndoing to help shape that better future.\nTwo years ago in this room, at our Eid reception, we launched a program called Generation\nChange to lead a grassroots agenda of positive engagement with Muslim communities. And I\nasked the young Muslim leaders in the audience that night to be our unofficial ambassadors, to\nhelp build personal connections, seek out partners in other countries. And I can report to you\ntonight they did not disappoint. In a few minutes, you're going to meet some of these young\nleaders, each with a powerful story to tell.\nThe Generation Change network that started in this room now circles the globe. We are building\nan international alliance of young people who want to drive change in their own communities.\nThey act as mentors, spark respectful debates, simply offer words of encouragement when\nneeded. But most importantly, they inspire others to keep expanding the circle of mutual\nunderstanding and respect, one person at a time.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Our 2012 Hours Against Hate initiative encourages\nyoung people to put themselves in another person's shoes through service projects. So far, young\npeople from all over the world have pledged thousands of volunteer hours to help people from a\ndifferent background, to see them as a fellow human being, not a stereotype, not a caricature, but\nanother real live person \u2014 people who don't look like you, live like you, pray like you, but with\nwhom we will share this planet. And therefore, we have work to do.\nPeople of faith and conscience are called to be the leaders of tolerance. In my tradition, like all\ntraditions, we are expected to love one another. And together, we have to translate that into better\nunderstanding and cooperation. I'm particularly pleased that the young people you will hear from\ntonight are really setting an example, not only for young people elsewhere in the world but,\nfrankly, for us who are older as well.\nLet me now call to the stage someone who has been a tremendous assistance to me in these\nefforts. Farah Pandith is the Department's first Special Representative to Muslim Communities.\nAnd from the beginning, she has made reaching out to young people and civil society her top\npriority. Farah will introduce you to three young leaders who I am very proud of\nRemarks at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony to Honor Those Lost in Attacks in Benghazi, Libya\nSeptember 14, 2012\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Chaplain. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President,\nSecretary Panetta, Ambassador Rice, Secretary Powell and Mrs. Powell, family members of the\nfour patriots and heroes we bring home, members of the State Department family, ladies and\ngentlemen, today we bring home four Americans who gave their lives for our country and our\nvalues. To the families of our fallen colleagues, I offer our most heartfelt condolences and\ndeepest gratitude.\nSean Smith joined the State Department after six years in the Air Force. He was respected as an\nexpert on technology by colleagues in Pretoria, Baghdad, Montreal, and The Hague. He enrolled\nin correspondence courses at Penn State and had high hopes for the future. Sean leaves behind a\nloving wife Heather, two young children, Samantha and Nathan, and scores of grieving family,\nfriends, and colleagues. And that's just in this world. Because online in the virtual worlds that\nSean helped create, he is also being mourned by countless competitors, collaborators, and garners\nwho shared his passion.\nTyrone Woods, known to most as Rone, spent two decades as a Navy SEAL, serving multiple\ntours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in\ndangerous posts from Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well\nas the arms of a warrior, earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. Our\nhearts go out to Tyrone's wife Dorothy, and his three sons Tyrone, Jr., Hunter, and Kai, born just\na few months ago, along with his grieving faii)ily, friends, and colleagues.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Glen deployed to some of the\nmost dangerous places on Earth, including Iraq and Afghanistan, always putting his life on the\nline to safeguard other Americans. Our thoughts and prayers are with Glen's father Bernard, his\nmother Barbara, his brother Gregory, his sister Kathleen, and their grieving families, friends, and\ncolleagues.\nI was honored to know Ambassador Chris Stevens. I want to thank his parents and siblings, who\nare here today, for sharing Chris with us and with our country. What a wonderful gift you gave\nus. Over his distinguished career in the Foreign Service, Chris won friends for the United States\nin far-flung places. He made those people's hopes his own. During the revolution in Libya, he\nrisked his life to help protect the Libyan people from a tyrant, and he gave his life helping them\nbuild a better country.\nPeople loved to work with Chris. And as he rose through the ranks, they loved to work for Chris.\nHe was known not only for his courage but for his smile \u2014 goofy but contagious \u2014 for his sense\nof fun and that California cool.\nIn the days since the attack, so many Libyans \u2014 including the Ambassador from Libya to the\nUnited States, who is with us today \u2014 have expressed their sorrow and solidarity. One young\nwoman, her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness, held up a handwritten sign that said\n\"Thugs and killers don't represent Benghazi nor Islam,\" The President of the Palestinian\nAuthority, who worked closely with Chris when he served in Jerusalem, sent me a letter\nremembering his energy and integrity, and deploring \u2014 and I quote \u2014 \"an act of ugly terror.\"\nMany others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments.\nThis has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We've seen the\nheavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We've seen rage\nand violence directed at American embassies over an awful interne video that we had nothing to\ndo with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because it is senseless, and it is\ntotally unacceptable.\nThe people of Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the\ntyranny of a mob. Reasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do\neverything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts. And\nwe will, under the President's leadership, keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the\nworld.\nThere will be more difficult days ahead, but it is important that we don't lose sight of the\nfundamental fact that America must keep leading the world. We owe it to those four men to\ncontinue the long, hard work of diplomacy. I am enormously proud of the men and women of the\nState Department. I'm proud of all those across our government, civilian and military alike, who\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

If the last few days teach us anything, let\nit be this: That this work and the men and women who risk their lives to do it are at the heart of\nwhat makes America great and good.\nSo we will wipe away our tears, stiffen our spines, and face the future undaunted. And we will\ndo it together, protecting and helping one another, just like Sean, Tyrone, Glen, and Chris always\ndid. May God bless them and grant their families peace and solace, and may God continue to\nbless the United States of America.\nAnd now, let me have the great honor of introducing someone who came to the State Department\nearlier this week to grieve with us. He well understands and values the work that these men were\ndoing for our country. The President of the United States.\nRemarks With Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Patricia Espinosa After Their\nMeeting\nSeptember 18, 2012\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it is such a pleasure for me to\nwelcome my friend and colleague, Secretary Espinosa, along with a very distinguished\ndelegation of officials from the Mexican Government for this continuation of consultation at the\nhighest levels of each of our governments.\nBefore I turn to the matters discussed today, let me give a brief update on the ongoing U.S.\nresponse to the protests in the Middle East and elsewhere. I'm sure as you know already, we are\ntaking aggressive steps to protect our staffs in embassies and consulates worldwide. That\nincludes reviewing our security posture at every post and augmenting it where necessary. And\nwe are working closely with the Libyan Government in our efforts to bring to justice those who\nmurdered our four American colleagues in Benghazi.\nThe FBI is now in Tripoli to join the investigation with Libyan officials, and there is nothing\nmore important to us than ensuring the safety of our American representatives worldwide. At the\nsame time, as I have said to State Department employees, the incidents of the past week highlight\nhow important our work is. The United States must and will remain strongly engaged in the\nworld. Our men and women risk their lives in service to our country and our values, because they\nknow that the United States must be a force for peace and progress. That is worth striving and\nsacrificing for, and nothing that happened last week changes this fundamental fact.\nNow, turning to our friends and partners in Mexico, we are always pleased to have a chance to\ndiscuss matters of mutual interest and concern between us. Mexico is one of our closest friends\nas well as partner on dozens of critical issues. So we talk about every kind of issue you can\nimagine, from education and healthcare to poverty alleviation to the environment. But today, we\nfocused on a top priority for us both a security.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nWe just co-chaired the fourth meeting of the U.S.-Mexico Merida High-Level Consultative\nGroup. This is the last one we will hold during the Calderon Administration. And I want to offer\nmy personal appreciation to President Calderon and to Foreign Secretary Espinosa for their\nleadership and commitment to this partnership and to all on both sides of the border in our\ngovernments who have been deeply engaged and committed to it. The Merida Initiative\nrepresents an unprecedented level of security cooperation between Mexico and the United States.\nAs our countries continue to deal with the serious challenge of transnational criminal\norganizations, including drug traffickers, illegal arms traffickers, money launderers, and violent\ngangs that threaten people on both sides of the border, we well know there is no quick and easy\nway to stop these criminals and bring them to justice. But nevertheless, during the past now\nnearly four years, our countries have collaborated to an extraordinary and unprecedented degree.\nWe have brought together policy makers and experts from across our governments and societies\nwho have worked hand in hand to keep our people safe. And I think the habits of cooperation we\nhave built are among our most important achievements, and we will rely on them for a long time\nto come.\nToday, our delegations reviewed the gains we've made on key priorities, including improving\nlaw enforcement coordination, reducing the demand for drugs, modernizing our border\ninfrastructure, strengthening the rule of law, and building more resilient and empowered\ncommunities. We also discussed the lessons we've learned and the work that lies ahead in these\nand other areas, which our joint statement will reflect. I want to underscore how important our\nsecurity relationship with Mexico is to the United States.\nThe Government of Mexico and the Mexican people have faced the threat posed by these\ncriminals with courage and resolve, and we remain committed to doing everything we can to\nsupport Mexico as it continues to work to bring those criminals to justice. This is a transnational\nproblem, and it calls for a transnational solution, and the United States believes this is a matter of\nshared responsibility. That was the first message I brought as Secretary of State when I came to\nMexico, and it continues to be the hallmark of our efforts together. Making sure our people are\nsafe and our neighbors are safe is of the utmost importance to us.\nNow, our two countries share many other priorities, and one of them, empowering women and\ngirls, was also addressed today. We took the opportunity, the Foreign Secretary and I, to sign a\nMemorandum of Understanding between our countries to work together to advance gender\nequality, empower girls and women, promote their human rights, and enhance their security.\nSo again, Secretary Espinosa, let me thank you for years of work and effort, for our productive\nconversations in many places around the world and again today, and for being such a valuable\ncolleague and partner. The United States deeply, deeply values our relationship with Mexico and\nthe ties of family and friendship that connect so many millions of our people.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

So thank you very much.\nMS. NULAND: We'll take (inaudible). Margaret Brennan, CBS News.\nQUESTION: Madam Secretary, thanks for your time. Are you any closer to finding who killed\nAmbassador Chris Stevens?, Libya's President says this attack was planned for months. Are you\nconfident he's wrong and that security measures were appropriate? And will you leave justice to\nthe Libyans?\nSECRETARY CLINTON: As I said at the outset, we are taking aggressive steps to protect our\npeople and our consulates and embassies around the world. We are reviewing our security\nposture at every post and working with host governments to be sure they know what our security-\nneeds are wherever necessary. We are also working closely with the Libyan Government to bring\nthe perpetrators to justice so that we can be assured that we have found who murdered our four,\ncolleagues and under what circumstances. As I said, the FBI has joined the investigation inside\nLibya, and we will not rest until the people who orchestrated this attack are found and punished.\nIt is also important to look at this strategically and understand what is going on across the region.\nIn a number of places where protests have tuned violent, we are seeing the hand of extremists\nwho are trying to exploit people's inflamed passions for their own agendas. But overwhelmingly,\nwe have found that the people of Egypt, of Libya, of Yemen and Tunisia are not prepared to\ntrade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob. They want to turn their attention to the\nfuture to provide better opportunities for themselves and their children, and they want a strong\npartnership with the United States and the American people based on mutual interests and mutual\nrespect.\nThis is part of a larger debate that is going on inside these societies. In Libya, for example, in\ntheir first free elections, moderates were successful at the polls. But look, there are extremists in\nall of these societies and on the outside who are working to take advantage of broad outrage in\norder to incite violence and specifically incite violence against Americans and American\nfacilities.\nAnd as I have said to many of the leaders I have spoken to over the past week, these extremist\nefforts are a threat to the people of the societies and the governments of those societies as well as\nto the region and the United States. And I think it's important at this moment for leaders to put\nthemselves on the right side of this debate - to speak out clearly and unequivocally against\nviolence, whoever incites it or conducts it\nAnd in a struggle like this, there can be no doubt where the United States must stand. We support\nthose who are fighting for the same values and rights that we believe in - in democracy, in\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

And I want to\nunderscore that the United States will continue to work with partners and allies in the region and\naround the world to help bring security to these nations so that the promise of the revolutions that\nthey experienced can be realized.\nAnd finally, on your specific point about Benghazi, we obviously never talk publicly about\nsecurity at any of our missions for obvious reasons. But that said, let me assure you that our\nsecurity in Benghazi included a unit of host government security forces, as well as a local guard\nforce of the kind that we rely on in many places around the world. In addition to the security\noutside the compound, we relied on a wall and a robust security presence inside the compound.\nAnd with all of our missions overseas, in advance of September lid', as is done every year, we\ndid an evaluation on threat streams. And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has\nsaid we had no actionable intelligence that an attack on our post in Benghazi was planned or\nimminent.\nBut let me state the obvious again. Our diplomats engage in dangerous work, and it's the nature\nof diplomacy in fragile societies and conflict zones to be aware of the necessity for security but\nto also continue the important diplomatic work that has to go on. There is risk inherent in what\nwe do and what these brave men and women representing the United States are up against every\nsingle day, and we do our very best to limit that risk by ensuring that our security protocols\nreflect the environments in which diplomats work and the threats that they are presented with.\nThank you.\nRemarks With Indonesian Foreign Minister Raden Mohammad Marty Muliana\nNatalegawa After Their Meeting\nSeptember 20, 2012\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it's such a pleasure, as always, to\nwelcome the Indonesian Foreign Minister, and I believe the largest delegation that has ever come\nfrom Indonesia, for the purpose of our third meeting of the U.S.-Indonesia Joint Commission.\nThis commission is the result of a vision by our two presidents for a comprehensive partnership,\nand the agreement to that effect was signed in 2010. Thanks to this partnership, the United States\nand Indonesia are working more closely than ever on a range of issues from global security to\nclean energy and climate to regional trade and commerce.\nAnd today, Marty and I had the chance to take stock of where our teams have come in the time\nof the last year, because we liad our meeting in Bali a year ago. And I must say, I was very\nimpressed. We covered a great deal today.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nBut before I start, I'd like to say a few words about the protests in several countries around the\nworld. We have condemned in the strongest possible terms the violence that has erupted from\nthese protests. And as I have said, the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and\nreprehensible, and the United States Government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it.\nBut there is no justification for violence, and I want to thank the Foreign Minister and his\ngovernment for speaking out against violence. We have to look to reasonable people and\nresponsible leaders everywhere to stand up to extremists who would seek to take advantage of\nthis moment to commit violent acts against embassies and their fellow countrymen.\nToday's meetings have highlighted the strong foundation that we have built together. And one of\nour most important concerns is promoting peace and stability in the Asia Pacific. Today, I'm\nannouncing that the Obama Administration has informed Congress of the potential sale of eight\nAH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters to the Indonesian Government. This agreement will\nstrengthen our comprehensive partnership and help enhance security across the region.\nOn growth and prosperity, we are increasing our trade relationship that topped $26 billion last\nyear. Investments in transportation, energy, and infrastructure are creating jobs and supporting\neconomic growth in both countries. For example, the deal between Lion Air and Boeing alone\nrepresents $21 billion in trade over the next decade. Indonesia's Government has announced half\na trillion dollars in infrastructure improvements, and we recently signed a memorandum of\nunderstanding to make it easier for American companies to bid on these projects.\nAnd yesterday, we signed an agreement for implementing our Millennium Challenge\nCorporation Compact with Indonesia. Over the next five years, the United States will invest $600\nmillion in clean energy development, child health and nutrition programs, and efforts to help\nmake Indonesia's Government more transparent and open.\nThe United States is also looking forward to Indonesia hosting APEC in 2013, and we are\nconfident that Indonesia will come to this role with a commitment to promote greater economic\nintegration across the Asia Pacific.\nBoth the Foreign Minister and I believe that strong education is essential to compete in a modem\nglobal economy. That's why the United States has expanded the Fulbright Program and\nsupported partnerships between dozens of American and Indonesian universities. Academic\nexchanges between our countries are up and applications from Indonesian students to visit the\nUnited States have increased by one third. USAID has recently expanded its basic education\nprogram to provide $83 million for teacher training and literacy programs for young children.\nAnd we're providing $20 in scholarship funding for Indonesian graduate students.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

The Foreign Minister's\npersonal leadership has helped lay the groundwork for diplomacy between ASEAN and China as\nit relates to the South China Sea. And we continue to support ASEAN's six-point principles,\nwhich we believe will help reduce tensions and pave the way for a comprehensive code of\nconduct for addressing disputes without threats, coercion, or use of force.\nFinally. Indonesia and the United States have stood together on a range of global challenges,\nfrom democratic reform in Burma to combating climate change, to working to end the violence\nin Syria. We are also coordinating efforts to further develop south-south and triangular\ncooperation, such as enhancing disaster preparedness in Burma and convening a conference on\nwomen's empowerment.\nWe believe that as the second and third-largest democracies in the world, the United States and\nIndonesia have a special responsibility to promote democracy and human rights. And for the last\nfour years, Indonesia has hosted the Bali Democracy Forum to promote peaceful, democratic\ntransitions through example and open dialogue. Last year, more than 80 countries attended. And\nonce again, the United States will be sending a high-level delegation.\nSo, Minister, thank you for everything. Thank you for the great partnership we've had between\nus and between our countries.\nMS. NULAND: We'll take two questions today, we'll start with Ros Jordan of Al Jazeera\nEnglish.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Madam Secretary, Mr. Foreign Minister. Madam Secretary, my\nquestion is about the ongoing investigation into last week's attack at the consulate in Benghazi.\nYou are meeting this afternoon with members of Congress to discuss the progress and the\nconcerns that they understandably have. First, there is the federal mandate to establish an\naccountability review board. Have you done so? Who would you like to see chair it? Are there\ncertain questions that you desperately want to have answered in order to safeguard the safety of\nForeign Service Officers around the world?\nAnd related to this, given the political instability and the successes of the past year and a half, are\nyou satisfied that in light of those political changes, enough was done to protect those working in\nthe Middle East and North Africa? And then finally \u2014 and this is perhaps going into the area of\nrumor and speculation \u2014 but there is at least one report suggesting that Ambassador Stevens felt\nthat he was on a, quote, \"al-Qaida hit list\" Is this a scurrilous rumor? Is this gallows humor\nwhen one is working in a period of difficulty and great challenge, or is there something more to\nwhat he allegedly \u2014 and I stress that word \u2014 said?\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

I will be briefing in two separate sessions, the House and the Senate, in\na classified setting, along with my interagency colleagues, as we continue to work together, and\nwith governments around the world, to ensure that our people and our facilities are safe. I will be\njoined today by the Director of National Intelligence, General Clapper, by the Deputy Secretary\nof Defense, Ash Carter, by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Sandy Winnefeld,\nalong with experts from the FBI, the State Department, and elsewhere in the government.\nNow, I anticipate that this briefing will cover our security posture before and during the events,\nand the steps we have taken since to do everything we can with host governments to protect our\npeople and our embassies and consulates. The Director of National Intelligence will speak to the\nintelligence issues surrounding these events in Libya. Deputy Secretary Carter will brief on the\nsuperb support we have had from the U.S. military in the wake of these events, and we are at the\nvery early stages of an FBI investigation. The team from the FBI reached Libya earlier this week.\nAnd I will advise Congress also that I am launching an accountability review board that will be\nchaired by Ambassador Thomas Pickering.\nI will also talk about the importance of the broader relationships with these countries in light of\nthe events of the past days. There are obviously very real challenges in these new democracies,\nthese fragile societies, but as I said last week, the vast majority of the people in these countries\ndid not throw off the tyranny of a dictator to trade it for the tyranny of a mob. And we are\nconcerned first and foremost with our own people and facilities, but we are concerned about the\ninternal security in these countries because ultimately, that puts at risk the men, women, and\nchildren of these societies on a daily ongoing basis if actions are not taken to try to restore\nsecurity and civil order.\nAnd let me just conclude by saying that there can be no doubt where the United States stands.\nWe continue to support those who are fighting for universal values \u2014 values that we see at work\nin Indonesia \u2014 the third largest democracy in the world. We believe that these values of universal\nrights, of justice and accountability, of democracy, are there for every person regardless of where\nthat person might live. So I will look forward to having a chance to talk with members of\nCongress.\nAs to your final question, I have absolutely no information or reason to believe that there's any\nbasis for that.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMS. NULAND: Last question. Victoria Sidjabat from Tempo Magazine, please.\nQUESTION: Yes. Madam, thank you.

If it's continuing happen, it's \u2014\nobviously could give impact to the implementation of (inaudible) program in Indonesia. What is\nthe reason U.S. Government closed the Embassy and Consulate in Indonesia? What is your\nexpectation from Indonesia Government, for my Minister Marty Natalegawa? How Indonesia\nGovernment respond to the closing of this Embassy and Consulate, it's starting today? Is U.S. \u2014\nIndonesia Government has capability to protect U.S. Embassy and Consulate. So the (inaudible)\nprogram implemented \u2014 could be implemented successfully in Indonesia. Thank you.\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Well, let me begin by saying how grateful we are for the excellent\ncooperation we have received from the Government of Indonesia, and in particular, from the law\nenforcement and security institutions in Indonesia. We are very grateful for not only the\ncooperation and protection that has been provided to our facilities, but also to the strong\nstatements condemning violence from the President, the Foreign Mihister, and others.\nIn consultation with the Government of Indonesia, we have temporarily, for tomorrow, closed\nour facilities. We want to be sure that law enforcement in Indonesia has the ability to do what it\nneeds to do to make sure that there is no disruption of civil order and security. So we are\ncooperating completely, and we're very grateful for the strong leadership provided by Indonesia.\nFOREIGN MINISTER NATALEGAWA: Hello, (inaudible), if I may just also respond.\nPrecisely as the Secretary had said, the decision by the United States Government to close\ntemporarily its embassies and consulates tomorrow in Indonesia is a decision that's been made\nbased on communication and conversation between the authorities in Indonesia and the United\nStates as well. So in other words, it is an informed decision, a decision that is not intended to\nshow any unfriendly intent on the part of anyone, but it is what it is, and it's quite some \u2014 it's the\nkind of step that governments actually carry out when situations requires it, even in our case.\nSome of our embassies abroad, when the situation requires us to have a temporary closing of the\nembassy, we do that as well. So it is something that is quite regular and something that is\nactually coordinated as well.\nBut if I may just broaden the subject matter, I think as our President had said in the past,\nIndonesian Government the Indonesian people, even, obviously cannot and would not condone\nthe \u2014 any acts of violence against diplomatic premises, against diplomatic personnel, because\nthat is, truly \u2014 would be a challenge to the efficient and a proper conduct of relations among\nstates. So that's our point of departure.\nAt the same time, of course, beyond the immediate issue of protection of the embassies, we have\nstill ahead of us the challenge of how to prevent the kind of situations where we are now at in\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

We've had the opportunity to meet in Islamabad and other\nsettings, but I am very pleased that we would have this chance to exchange views on our bilateral\nrelationship as well as regional and global issues.\nI want to begin by addressing the events of the day and the past week. Today, we've once again\nseen protests in several cities in Pakistan. Unfortunately, some of those protests have turned\nviolent and, sadly, resulted in loss of life. I want to thank the Government of Pakistan for their\nefforts to protect our Embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Lahore, Peshawar, and Karachi.\nAnd I want to be clear, as I have said on numerous occasions, the violence we have seen cannot\nbe tolerated. There is no justification for violence. Of course, there is provocation, and we have\ncertainly made clear that we do not in any way support provocation. We found the video that's at\nthe core of this series of events offensive, disgusting, reprehensible.\nBut that does not provide justification for violence, and therefore it is important for responsible\nleaders, indeed responsible people everywhere, to stand up and speak out against violence and\nparticularly against those who would exploit this difficult moment to advance their own\nextremist ideologies.\nYesterday afternoon when I briefed the Congress, I made it clear that keeping our people\neverywhere in the world safe is our top priority. What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist\nattack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who\nmurdered four Americans. And we are taking aggressive measures at all of our posts to protect\nour staffs and their families along with locally employed people who provide so many important\ncontributions to the work of our missions.\nThe Foreign Minister and I will have a chance to cover a full range of subjects today, and it is no\nsecret that the past year and a half has been challenging for Pakistan and the United States. And\nwe still have work to do to get our bilateral relationship to the point where we would like it to be,\nbut we both recognize that we can achieve more when we work together on a focused agenda.

I look forward to seeing President Zardari next week\nat the UN General Assembly. At each meeting, we are working to identify the strategic goals we\nshare \u2014 and there are many \u2014 and the concrete actions we can each take to accomplish them.\nOur number one shared priority remains pursuing our joint counterterrorism objectives to ensure\nthe security of American and Pakistani citizens alike. We face a common threat from a common\nenemy, and we must confront terrorism and extremism together. Earlier this month, I designated\nthe Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization so we could make full use of every\navailable legal authority to end their deadly attacks. Pakistan's parliament has called for\nexpelling foreign fighters so that Pakistan's territory can be fully under control of the Pakistani\nGovernment and cannot be used to launch attacks against other nations.\nAnd the follow-through on this is challenging but necessary, and we look forward to working\nwith Pakistan as they continue to address these problems. We have both pledged to support a\nsecure, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan, which is vital for the security of the region. And I\nwant to thank Foreign Minister Khar for Pakistan's reopening of the NATO supply lines to allow\nthe movement of goods to Afghanistan.\nWe will discuss the successful first meeting of the Safe Passage Working Group in Islamabad\nwhich brought together Afghan, Pakistani, and U.S. representatives to advance the peace process\nin Afghanistan. The Pakistani Government's public call for insurgents to come forward and talk\nwith the Afghan Government was particularly important. We are ready to work together to build\non these steps, and we will continue our discussions through bilateral consultations and the U.S.-\nAfghanistan-Pakistan Core Group.\nNow, of course, our relationship goes far beyond our shared security concerns, and today we will\ndiscuss the many other ways in which we work together, particularly to create economic\nopportunity for Pakistanis. Foreign Minister Khar and I agree that we need to shift our economic\nrelationship from aid to trade and investment. We are working to help Pakistan attract more\nprivate sector investment. We hope to finalize a bilateral investment treaty soon. And we've\ncreated a Pakistan private investment initiative to help more of Pakistan's small and medium\nsized companies get access to capital.\nOver the past few years, we have seen Pakistan's civilian government begin to put down stronger\nroots. And if elections proceed as planned next year, it will mark the first time in Pakistan's\nhistory that a civilian-led government has served its full term. The United States supports\nPakistan's economic development, and we have said many times that we want to see democracy\nsucceed in Pakistan.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

I am pleased to welcome the Foreign Minister from\nTunisia I'm looking forward to our meeting, We obviously have a great deal to discuss, and I\nwant to thank the Foreign Minister and the Government of Tunisia for their efforts over the last\nweek to help secure our Embassy and the American Cooperative School of Tunis following the\nviolent assaults of last Friday.\nWe are monitoring events closely today. There is no higher priority for President Obama and\nmyself than the safety of our people. We've taken a number of steps around the world to\naugment security and to protect our personnel at diplomatic posts. And we are working closely\nwith host governments in this effort.\nAs I have said before and as is embodied in the Vienna Convention and other international\nagreements, all governments have the duty, the solemn duty, to defend diplomatic missions.\nThey must be safe and protected places so that governments can exchange views and work on\nmany important issues, and leaders across the world must stand up and be counted in rejecting\nviolence and holding violent actors accountable.\nWe are working closely with the Government of Tunisia They have assisted us in enhancing the\nsecurity of our facilities. We've also discussed with them the imperative of bringing to justice\nthose responsible for these violent attacks. And we have offered and will continue to look for\nways that we can assist the new Government of Tunisia in ensuring the rule of law throughout\ntheir country, first and foremost for the people of Tunisia themselves. We look forward to\ncontinuing to build our hew partnership with the Tunisian Government and people. Our\nrelationship is built around the shared principles of all democracies \u2014 a commitment to\nnonviolence, to tolerance, and inclusivity for all people, and to upholding the rule of law.\nThe Tunisian people have bravely put themselves on the road to democracy. They were the first\nof the Arab revolutions and they have made important progress in a very short period of time.\nThey have worked too hard and sacrificed too much over too many years to see their progress\nhijacked at derailed by extremists with Ulric own a5,-.\n,\n,encia.

PJ\nBEGIN TEXT\nQuestions have been raised regarding remarks by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on September 30 before the United\nNations Security Council on the adoption of a resolution to combat sexual violence in armed conflict. In her statement,\nshe said that we have seen rape used as a tactic before in a number of countries, including Sri Lanka.\nRegarding the Secretary's reference to Sri Lanka in her address, we want to be clear. Over the course of the difficult\nconflict between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), stretching into this\ndecade, the State Department as well as credible human rights organizations reported numerous cases of rape and\nsexual violence in Sri Lanka, particularly acts committed against women held in detention by the government. This was\nthe basis for the Secretary's statement. At the same time, in the most recent phase of the conflict, from 2006 to 2009,\nthough we remained deeply concerned about reports of extrajudicial killings, disappearances and mistreatment of\ndetainees, we have not received reports that rape and sexual abuse were used as tools of war, as they clearly have in\nother conflict areas around the world. We hope that this clarification puts the issue in its proper context.\nThese questions should not detract from the specific actions that Sri Lanka needs to take now. With the end of the\nmilitary conflict, Secretary Clinton believes strongly that Sri Lanka must focus to the future and move forward on the\npromotion of peace and the protection of human rights. The government of Sri Lanka should release more than 250,000\ndisplaced persons who are still confined in camps, and lead a process of genuine political and social reconciliation.

V5-\nrvi,-\n,\n,\nc.:! (by which I mean today's lamentable, straight-party-line Supreme Court\nruline\n;that removes limits from direct corporate underwriting of political campaigns) -- there is one other event today that\nwill have big ripple effects. i mean SecState Hillary Clinton's speech this morning about \"Internet Freedom,\" mentioned\n;:lere and with a prelude discussion\nI'm not going to take time for a thorough gloss of the speech. Instead I highly recommend reading the full text, lette, or\nwatching the official video, .'tere. And for now some of the main points while listening (and noting main points down in real\ntime with the handy '\nuiveaSccibe, pen.)\n- In contrast to the dreamy Internet optimism of a decade or so ago -- I'm not naming names, but I remember! -- when\nmany people imagined that info technology, by itself, would undermine oppression and bring the world together, Clinton\nstarted off with a very astringent reminder that this technology, like others, was neither good or bad in itself and is already\nbeing used in both helpful and destructive ways:\n\"Amid this unprecedented surge in connectivity, we must also recognize that these technologies are not\nan unmitigated blessing. These tools are also being exploited to undermine human progress and political\nrights. Just as steel can be used to build hospitals or machine guns, or nuclear power can either energize\na city or destroy it, modern information networks and the technologies they support can be harnessed for\ngood or for ill. The same networks that help organize movements for freedom also enable al-Qaida to\nspew hatred and incite violence against the innocent. And technologies with the potential to open up\naccess to government and promote transparency can also be hijacked by governments to crush dissent\nand deny human rights.\"\nAnd a very nice pivot out of this section, effective because it's so blunt and plain:\n\"On their own, new technologies do not take sides in the struggle for freedom and progress, but the\nUnited States does.\"\n- Underscoring the \"this is a big deal\" tone of the speech, she enumerated the \"Four Freedoms\" that FDR proclaimed in\n1941, as part of the struggle for the world's future, and said there were a comparable set of Four Freedoms for the\nInternet age. Check out the speech yourself for details.\n- The China surprise: the speech was a more frontal challenge to Chinese internet and overall censorship policy than I\nexpected, and than I recall in other US-China interactions in a very long time. For instance, early in the speech, an\nitemization of the places where suppression is getting worse:\n\"In the last year, we've seen a spike in threats to the free flow of information. China, Tunisia, and\nUzbekistan have stepped up their censorship of the Internet. In Vietnam, access to popular social\nnetworking sites has suddenly disappeared. And last Friday in Egypt, 30 bloggers and activists were\ndetained.\"\nTunisia, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Egypt -- this is not the grouping of countries that the Chinese government, in its recent\nsense of rise to superpower status, is used to being lumped with. Compared to the US as a financial power, OK;\novertaking japan in economic size, yes; being a crucial player in environmental negotiations.., all that is one thing.\nBracketed in the same sentence with Tunisia and Uzbekistan is different. Sentences like this don't appear in formal, big-\ndeal SecState addresses by accident.\nOther passages to the same effect:\n\"As I speak to you today, government censors somewhere are working furiously to erase my words from\nthe records of history. But history itself has already condemned these tactics....\n\"Those who disrupt the free flow of information in our society or any other pose a threat to our economy,\nour government, and our civil society. Countries or individuals that engage in cyber attacks should face\nconsequences and international condemnation....\"\nAnd then the Google section itself.\nI had wondered whether the speech would mention Google by name -- and had reason to think it might not. (Main\nargument forleavina it implicit rather than referring directly to the Google case: in the company's ongoing efforts to find a\n\"il\nlvineyiftaiv_in\" acceptable way to remain in China, rather than a lose-lose-lose permanent split, its not necessarily a help\nto have the U.S. government standing officially by its side. ) But the way Sec. Clinton introduced the point was significant:\nas a proxy for China's own ability to H.to,tentiai and sustain its economic rise:\n\"To use market terminology, a publicly listed company in Tunisia or Vietnam that operates in an\nenvironment of censorship will always trade at a discount relative to an identical firm in a free society. If\ncorporate decision makers don't have access to global sources of news and information, investors will\nhave less confidence in their decisions over the long term. Countries that censor news and information\nmust recognize that from an economic standpoint, there is no distinction between censoring political\nspeech and commercial speech. If businesses in your nations are denied access to either type of\ninformation, it will inevitably impact on growth.\n\"Increasingly, U.S. companies are making the issue of internet and information freedom a greater\nconsideration in their business decisions. I hope that their competitors and foreign governments will pay\nclose attention to this trend. The most recent situation involving Google has attracted a great deal of\ninterest. And we look to the Chinese authorities to conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions that\nled Google to make its announcement. And we also look for that investigation and its results to be\ntransparent.\n\"The Internet has already been a source of tremendous progress in China, and it is fabulous. There are\nso many people in China now online. But countries that restrict free access to information or violate the\nbasic rights of internet users risk walling themselves off from the progress of the next century. Now, the\nUnited States and China have different views on this issue, and we intend to address those differences\ncandidly and consistently in the context of our positive, cooperative, and comprehensive relationship.\"\nThere's a lot more in the speech, including about terrorism, disaster relief, religion, etc -- but it's there for the reading.\nBack to the to-do list for me now.\nPeirmalink\n.Share This", "nbr_mention": 3, "sentiment": 0, "sentence": " china, tunisia, and\nuzbekistan have stepped up their censorship of the internet"}, "India": {"mention": ["india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india", "india"], "text": "H <hrod17@clintonemail.com>\nMonday, May 4, 2009 4:08 PM\n'Jake.Sulliva\nRe: Kazakhstan ii at\nOk w me.

Obama as weak on terrorism\nBy cY'aia?,_\n(Credit: AP/AI Behrman/Salort)\nAccording to a highly reliable source, as Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama prepare for the\nfirst presidential debate Wednesday night, top Republican operatives are primed to unleash a new\ntwo-pronged offensive that will attack Obama as weak on national security, and will be based, in part,\non inW !ia:en,y-.3iTeForrnation regarding the attacks in Libya that killed U.S. ambassador Chris\nStevens on September\nThe source, who has first-hand knowledge of private, high-level conversations in the Romney tamp\nthat took place in Washington, DC last week, said that at various times the GOP strategists referred to\ntheir new operation as the Jimmy Carter Strategy or the October Surprise.\nHe added that they planned to release what they hoped would be \"a bombshell\" that would make\nLibya and Obama's foreign policy a major issue in the campaign. \"My understanding is that they have\ncome up with evidence that the Obama administration had positive intelligence that there was going\nto be a terrorist attack on the intelligence.\"\nThe source described the Republicans as chortling with glee that the Obama administration\n\"definitely had intel\" about the attack before it happened. \"Intelligence can be graded in different\nways,\" he added, \"and sometimes A and B don't get connected. But [the Romney campaign] will try to\npaint it to look like Obama had advance knowledge of the attack and is weak on terrorism.\"\nHe said they were jubilant about their new strategy and said they intended to portray Obama as a\nhelpless, Jimmy Carter-like president and to equate the tragedy in Libya with President Carter's failed\nattempt to rescue American hostages in Iran in t980. \"They are so excited about it,\" he said. \"Over\nand over again they talked about bow it would be just like Jimmy Carter's failed raid. They feel it is\ngoing to give them .a last-minute landslide in the election.\"\nThe source, however, said lie was dubious about the tactic. \"To me, it is indicative that they have lost\ntouch with a huge portion of the electorate,\" he said.\nThe source declined to reveal the names of the GOP operatives who were present. But he said, \"These\nwere the top guys in the party. It was a .private, unguarded planning conversation.\" He further\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739615\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

He declined to discuss what he described as the second phase of the\noperation.\nHowever, already there is evidence that the first phase of the operation is underway. On Wednesday,\nSeptember 26, on Fox News, Karl Rove called Obama's reaction to what happened in Libya\n\"inexplicable\" and added that Obama is \"more intent on campaigning than meeting his\nresponsibilities as commander-in-chief.\" He went on to warn that Obama's policies in Libya\nendangered the U.S. with regard to Iran. \"I am astonished,\" Rove said. \"We are projecting weakness\nwhen we need to be projecting strength.\"\nSimilarly, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a one-time GOP presidential hopeful who\nbecame known as the mayor of 9/11, followed Rove in criticizing Obama on the attack in Libya. \"This\nis a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth, from an administration that claimed it wanted to be the\nmost transparent in history,\" he told Fox News. \"And it's the worst kind of cover-up: the kind of\ncover-up that involves our national security. This is a cover-up that involves the slaughter of four\nAmericans.\"\nGiuliani added that the Obama White House wanted to dismiss the role played by al-Qaeda because it\nseemed to diminish the triumph of having killed Osama bin Laden. \"I think it's because they have this\nnarrative that they defeated al-Qaeda,\" he said. \"They never say the words 'Islamic fundamentalist\nterrorism'. They want to wish it away. The president was moving on to Asia \u2014 he was going to declare\nthis a great victory for himself and unfortunately, this terrible act of terror intervened in their very\nconvenient narrative.\"\nLikewise, Bob Corker, Republican senator from Tennessee, described the administration's response to\n\"the terrorist attack\" in Libya as And on Sunday, September 30, both Mitt Romney and\nvice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan joined in the attacks. \"I think they want to do their very best to\nkeep the people of America from understanding exactly what happened. We expect candor, we expect\ntransparency, particularly as it relates to terrorism,\" Romney said.\nAdded Ryan, \"Why is he (Obama) not on the same page with his own administration officials who are\nsaying that this is a terrorist attack? We'll leave it up to you to decide whether it's a cover-up or not.\"\nIn an apparently related development, a Politico artkle posted last night said Romney advisers were\ndivided over hovv aggressively to attack President Obama over his handling of the events in Libya. One\nunnamed Romney adviser described them as \"a huge gift\" to the campaign. \"Across the board \u2014\ndomestic, economic and foreign-policy issues \u2014 President Obama has been outmatched by events,\" he\nsaid. \"He's an observer of events, not a shaper of events. Everywhere you look, he's been outmatched.\"\nBut other Romney advisers, led by media strategist Stuart Stevens, wanted to stick to the economy as\nthe central issue. \"They'll tell you that you've got to focus people on the fact that their economic\nprospects are not very good and all that,\" the aide told Politico. \"Well, Romney's been trying to do that\nnow since he clinched the nomination at the end of April \u2014 and he's failed. The president is better at\ndeflecting attention from the bad news than Romney is at driving home the impact of the bad news on\nindividual voters.\"\nCraig Unger is the New York Times bestselling author of \"House of Bush, House of Saud,\" and a\nfrequent analyst on CNN, ABC Radio, Air America, The Charlie Rose Show, NBC's Today Show and\nother broadcast outlets.

Photograph: Julien Behal/PA\nJustice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland's power-sharing government from 12 April in a historic\ndeal agreed by the main parties that \"opens a new chapter\" after decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.\nStanding alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the\nprime minister said the \"inspirational\" agreement between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) was a\nfoundation for lasting peace.\nThe deal \u2014 finally agreed to by the DUP last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for\npeace \u2014 comes after two weeks of round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing\ngovernment might collapse.\nIt will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans\non overseeing parades.\nBrown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of \"a new spirit of mutual co-\noperation and respect\".\nThe deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing\nexecutive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including\nthe abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.\nA cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers are\ndevolved from London on 12 April.\nBrown told reporters: \"The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement\nbelongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This is\nthe last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of talks,\nweeks of stalemate.\"\nCowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making \"fair and balanced compromises\" to bridge the divisions and\nsaid the quality of the negotiations meant that the \"devolved institutions can and will work\".\nThe Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have\nlaunched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal\nwould \"absolutely\" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.\nThe DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement \"will be more enduring because of the time spent\" in forming it.\nReferring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 when negotiations bore fruit at the 11th hour, the Sinn Fein president,\nGerry Adams, described the current deal and the rescue of power-sharing as \"yet another very good Friday\".\nJeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.\nBut the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up\nlegislation to change the way parades are judged.\nA UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two\ngovernments. \"We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be signing up to it,\" she said.\nThe talks, which centred on Hillsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in the\nnear 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last\nthree years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led by\nthe two parties.\nThe agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont's parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said the\nbasis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it. Robinson\nemerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the proposals. Earlier\nin the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give unionists enough\nconcessions.\nRobinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal. \"We\nhave a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in Northern\nIreland and to the community.\n\"An essential element of the Democratic Unionist Party's manifesto is the requirement for community confidence; we\nbelieve this can be the basis for gaining that confidence.\"\nHowever the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, questioned why the 14 DUP rebels had\nchanged their minds.\n\"The deal hasn't changed, only the snowmen of the DUP, who melted once the heat came on,\" Allister said.\nThe DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election: Allister will portray the deal\nas a sell-out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism.", "nbr_mention": 4, "sentiment": -1, "sentence": "\"\nHowever the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, questioned why the 14 DUP rebels had\nchanged their minds"}, "Seychelles": {"mention": ["victoria", "victoria", "victoria", "victoria", "victoria", "victoria"], "text": "Amazing.\nSullivan, Jacob J <Sullivanii@state,gov>\nWednesday, September 12, 2012 10:34 PM\nSherman, Wendy R; H; Mills, Cheryl D; Nuland, Victoria J; Reines, Philippe\nRe: The Youth of Libya", "nbr_mention": 6, "sentiment": 0, "sentence": "\nsullivan, jacob j <sullivanii@state,gov>\nwednesday, september 12, 2012 10:34 pm\nsherman, wendy r; h; mills, cheryl d; nuland, victoria j; reines, philippe\nre: the youth of libya"}, "United Kingdom": {"mention": ["london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london", "london"], "text": "Secretary Clinton's leadership on Libya\nHRC has been a critical voice on Libya in administration deliberations, at NATO, and in contact group meetings \u2014 as well\nas the public face of the U.S. effort in Libya.

We were followed by extensive remarks from the NATO ambassadors, all of whom\ntouched on the importance of women's role in security and NATO's mission, as well as applauded US leadership. Many\nmentioned you in their interventions! The ambs from Serbia, Azerbaijan and Georgia pointed to their own national\naction plans (their existence was a surprise to us), as well as the new structures they have put in place to implement\nthem. The ambassador from Azerbaijan even said that he is hopeful women will contribute to ending their regional\nconflict (I will tell Morningstar). The new special rep - a seasoned diplomat who knows her way around NATO --- wanted\nme to ten you how much you have inspired her -- something I hear everywhere!\nI'm confident our NATO visit also served to reinforce the importance of the NAP and the US role with our own people\nboth at NATO and DOD.\nI was sorry to miss the discussion with ASSK but there are more events with her tomw. We are working hard on getting\nthe engagement of Burmese women into the formal peace structures being put in place to end the ethnic conflicts.\nI also met with Vivian Redding at the EU who, despite her efforts, is unlikely to get a quota for women on public boards\nof directors adopted. She too expressed her admiration of you and your leadership.\nIn addition to everything that's been said about Chris Stevens, he really understood the important role the women in\nLibya were playing in peace and security. Whenever I met with Libyan women at meetings in the region, they went out\nof their way to tell me how much he supported them and how much affection they had for him. Such an awful loss.\nYou've been magnificent throughout all this, despite how wrenching it's been.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739739\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

First of all, their friendship with the US and\nrespect for you was much in evidence on all levels. Most of the cabinet turned out for the reception that the amb hosted\nfor me. The FM went out his way to tell me what it meant to get a call from you when he assumed his position (he's\nhoping to have a few mins with you in Tallin). As far as Lith has to go, it has achieved some remarkable achievements for\nEastern Eur. They have a female president, Speaker, Finance minister and def. minister. I had a good meeting with the\nPresident and thanked her for Lith commitment to our collective efforts in afghanistan. They run the smallest PRT and,\ndespite a tough economy, have done everything we've asked in terms of additional support since the surge. The meeting\nwith the Speaker and top women members of the parl'nt was yet another reminder of your inspiration over many years.\nOne of the women was at the Vienna W conf and said she's in politics today because of you. Another read about safe\nbirthing kits in your book and was inspired to send several thousand to Afghanistan. They are eager for more\nopportunities to work together.\nI came primarily to launch the new working group on gender that we and Lith are co-chairing. There was much gratitude\nfor our leadership with them in the Community of Democracies.\nThe meaning of democracy is so strong for people who had to stuggle for it more recently. They really feel this is an\nimportant time to renew the understanding of democ, particularly after the bruising it underwent over the last several\nyears.\nWe had terrific turnout from other countries, many comments about you and references to Beijing and Iceland W conf.\n(So many people told me the impact Vienna and Iceland had on them). We left our meeting with many commitments for\nfuture concrete projects that will be undertaken. There is great hope that you will be in Krakow in July for the CD\nministerial. The Lith CD coordinator headed to Belgium the next day for an EU meeting. He told me he got a very positive\nresponse for our gender initiative and that Ashton was particularly excited about it. The EU is locating their new gender\ninstitute in Lithuania and they are ager for our help.\nThe Dutch minister who came\nsaid the outcome of their election in June will say much about the nature of their ongoing commitment in Afg.\nLastly, I arrived shortly after the Polish tragedy. There is a very close relationship between the 2 countries and their grief\nwas palpable. Jolenta Kwasniewska and several other Poles came to the CD meeting.

Libya's rampant militias, the crowd overwhelmed the compound of the\nAnsar Al-Sharlah Brigade in the center of the eastern city of Benghazi.\nAnsar Al-Shariah fighters initially fired in the air to disperse the crowd, but eventually abandoned the site with their\nweapons and vehicles after it was overrun by waves of protesters shouting \"No to militias.\"\n\"I don't want to see armed men wearing Afghani-style clothes stopping me in the street to give me orders, I only want to\nsee people in uniform,\" said Omar Mohammed, a university student who took part in the takeover of the site, which\nprotesters said was done in support of the army and police.\nNo deaths were reported in the incident, which came after tens of thousands marched in Benghazi against armed\nmilitias. One vehicle was also burned at the compound.\nFor many Libyans, the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was the last straw in one of the biggest\nproblems Libya has faced since the ouster and death of longtime dictator Moamrnar Qaddafi around a year ago -- the\nmultiple mini-armies that with their arsenals of machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades are stronger than the\nregular armed forces and police.\nThe militias, a legacy of the rag-tag popular forces that fought Qaddafi's regime, tout themselves as protectors of Libya's\nrevolution, providing security where police cannot. But many say they act like gangs, detaining and intimidating rivals\nand carrying out killings.\nMilitias made up of Islamic radicals like Ansar Al-Shariah are notorious for attacks on Muslims who don't abide by their\nhardline ideology. Officials and witnesses say fighters from Ansar Al-Shariati led the attack on the U.S. consulate, which\nkilled Amb. Chris Stevens and three other Americans.\nAfter taking over the Ansar compound, protesters then drove to attack the Benghazi headquarters of another Islamist\nmilitia, Rafallah Sahati. The militiamen opened fire on the protesters, who were largely unarmed. At least 20 were\nwounded, and there were unconfirmed witness reports of three protesters killed.\nEarlier in the day, some 30,000 people filled a broad boulevard as they marched along a lake in central Benghazi on\nFriday to the gates of the headquarters of Ansar Al-Shariah.\n\"No, no, to militias,\" the crowd chanted, filling a broad boulevard. They carried banners and signs demanding that\nmilitias disband and that the government build up police to take their place in keeping security. \"Benghazi is in a trap,\"\nsigns read. \"Where is the army, where is the police?\"\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739766\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nOther signs mourned the killing of Stevens, reading, \"The ambassador was Libya's friend\" and \"Libya lost a friend.\"\nMilitary helicopters and fighter jets flew overhead, and police mingled in the crowd, buoyed by the support of the\nprotesters.\nThe march was the biggest seen in Benghazi, Libya's second largest city and home to 1 million people, since the fall of\nQaddafi in August 2011. The public backlash comes in part in frustration with the interim government, which has been\nunable to rein in the armed factions. Many say that officials' attempts to co-opt fighters by paying them have only fueled\nthe growth of militias without bringing them under state control or integrating them into the regular forces.\nResidents of another main eastern city, Darna, have also begun to stand up against Ansar Al-Shariah and other militias.\nThe anti-militia fervor in Darna is notable because the city, in the mountains along the Mediterranean coast north of\nBenghazi, has long had a reputation as a stronghold for Islamic extremists. During the Qaddafi era, it was the hotbed of a\ndeadly Islamist insurgency against his regime.\nA significant number of the Libyan jihadists who travelled to Afghanistan and Iraq during recent wars came from Darna.\nDuring the revolt against him last year, Qaddafi's regime warned that Darna would declare itself an Islamic Emirate and\nally itself with Al Qaeda.\nBut now, the residents are lashing out against Ansar Al-Shariah, the main Islamic extremist group in the city.\n\"The killing of the ambassador blew up the situation. It was disastrous,\" said Ayoub al-Shedwi, a young bearded Muslim\npreacher in Darna who says he has received multiple death threats because has spoken out against militias on a radio\nshow he hosts. \"We felt that the revolution is going in vain.\"\nLeaders of tribes, which are the strongest social force in eastern Libya, have come forward to demand that the militias\ndisband.\nTribal leaders in Benghazi and Darna announced this week that members of their tribes who are militiamen will no\nlonger have their protection in the face of anti-militia protests. That means the tribe will not avenge them if they are\nkilled.\nActivists and residents have held a sit-in for the past eight days outside Darna's Sahaba Mosque, calling on tribes to put\nan end to the \"state of terrorism\" created by the militias.\nMilitiamen have been blamed for a range of violence in Darna. On the same day Stevens killed in Benghazi, a number of\nelderly Catholic nuns and a priest who have lived in Darna for decades providing free medical services, were attacked,\nreportedly beaten or stabbed. There have been 32 killings over the past few months, including the city security chief and\nassassinations of former officers from Qaddafi's military.\nDarna's residents are conservative, but they largely don't fit the city's reputation as extremists.\nWomen wear headscarves, but not the more conservative black garb and veil that covers the entire body and face. In\nthe ancient city's narrow alleys, shops display sleeveless women dresses and the young men racing by in cars blare\nWestern songs.\nAnd many are impatient with Ansar Al-Sharjah's talk of imposing its strict version of Islamic law. The group's name\nmeans \"Supporters of Shariah Law.\"\n\"We are not infidels for God sake, We have no bars, no discos, we are not practicing vice in the street,\" said Wassam ben\nMadin, a leading activist in the city who lost his right eye in clashes with security forces on the first day of the uprising\nagainst Qaddafi. \"This is not the time for talk about Sharjah.

We will tell\nthem you are from us and you fought for us\" during the civil war against Qaddafi. But 'if you say no (to integrating into\nthe) police and army, we will storm your place. It's over.\"\nOfficials in the interim government and security forces say they are not strong enough to crack down on the militias. The\narmed factions have refused government calls for them to join the regular army and police.\nSo the government has created a \"High Security Committee\" aimed at grouping the armed factions as a first step to\nintegration, Authorities pay fighters a salary of as much as 1,000 dinars, around $900, to join -- compared to the average\npolice monthly salary of around $200.\nHowever, the militias that join still do not abide by government authority, and critics say the lure of salaries has only\nprompted more militias to form.\nOfficials and former rebel commanders estimate the number of rebels that actually fought in the 8-month civil war\nagainst Gadhafi at around 30,000. But those now listed on the High Security Committee payroll have reached several\nhundred thousand.\n\"All these militia and entities are fake ones but it is mushrooming,\" said Khaled Hadar, a Benghazi-based lawyer.

In pursuit of its narrow and even\ncrude understanding of its interest, China will constantly abuse and break international rules, protocols and bodies. Its\nwillful destruction of the Copenhagen summit on climate change reveals the pattern. Its mercantile currency policy in a\nbeggar-thy-neighbour approach, environmental degradation, and disdain for human rights and the rule of law generally\nare the obvious reflections of its despotism. Through its rough and strange neo-imperialism, in Africa especially but also\nelsewhere, China is able to gain help, partly through economic intimidation, in its international forays to repel or strike\ndown the responsibilities of internationalism.\nInternally, China is a prison of nations, an empire similar to imperial Russia and the Soviet Union, and may also be the\nmost unequal industrial country in distribution of income. China's power is increasing, but the authoritarian regime is\nhardly the wave of the future as some awestruck worshippers of raw power and money (whether investment bankers or\nex-Marxists) imagine. The system is inherently unstable, which accounts for its rigid currency policy (at root a fear of\noperating on other than a virtual slave-labour standard, of turning its poverty-stricken millions into consumers with real\nchoice, and ultimately of letting go even a little bit).\nIn the long-term the tyranny of the one-party state and its military rule is at odds with the new economic classes of\nentrepreneurs and professionals it has fostered. China's growing economic power is accompanied by expanding\narrogance, demonstrated not least in the incivility and rudeness with which President Obama was treated on his trip there.\nChina's regime lacks an ideal other than a communist gloss on Confucian uniformity, itself based incoherently on reckless\neconomic development, for example in the areas of currency, environment and labour; it has no \"soft power\", not just\nbecause of the coarseness of its supposed diplomacy, but also because its cultural appeal does not travel. China forces\nits way through coercion of one sort or another.\nThe next decade will see how flexible or inflexible its rulers are and how secure their system is. The brief effort at a\nrhetorical gesture by some in the Obama administration who floated the turgid phrase \"strategic reassurance\" was risible\nand did not last. For now, the west has no policy to deal with China as it is. The place to begin is on currency.\nThe most powerful idea for the 21st century is the equality of women. It is the idea most feared by those - from the Vatican\nto the Taliban - arrayed against modernity, the still vibrant project of the Enlightenment. Someday the United States may\neven have a woman president. It took fifty years after granting the vote to African-Americans to pass a constitutional\namendment giving it to women. Perhaps the distance between electing the first African-American president and the first\nfemale one will not be so great.\nSidney Blumenthal is former senior adviser to President Clinton, and an Oscar and Emmy award-winning documentary\nproducer.

As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans\non the ground in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to\nbuild the foundation for a new, free nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work\nthat he started.

Heavily armed militants\nassaulted the compound and set fire to our buildings. American and Libyan security personnel\nbattled the attackers together. Four Americans were killed. They included Sean Smith, a Foreign\nService information management officer, and our Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. We are\nstill making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals.\nThis is an attack that should shock the conscience of people of all faiths around the world. We\ncondemn in the strongest terms this senseless act of violence, and we send our prayers to the\nfamilies, friends, and colleagues of those we've lost.\nAll over the world, every day, America's diplomats and development experts risk their lives in\nthe service of our country and our values, because they believe that the United States must be a\nforce for peace and progress in the world, that these aspirations are worth striving and sacrificing\nfor.

He spent 10 years as an information management officer\nin the State Department, he was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary\nassignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather, with whom I spoke this morning. He was a\nfather to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being proud of the\nservice their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and\nfinally to Benghazi.\nThe mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary,\nand we and the people of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy.\nToday, many Americans are asking \u2014 indeed, I asked myself\u2014 how could this happen? How\ncould this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from destruction?\nThis question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be.\nBut we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group \u2014\nnot the people or Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a\ncountry scarred by war and tyranny, they were hailed as friends and partners. And when the\nattack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post. Some were wounded.\nLibyans carried Chris' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to\nsafety. And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the\nviolence and pledged every effort to protect our people and pursue those responsible.\nThe friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty\nof this attack. A free and stable Libya is still in America's interest and security, and we will not\nturn our back on that, nor will we rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and\nbrought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities to move swiftly and\nsurely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American\nembassies, consulates, and citizens.\nThere will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher\npriority than protecting our men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine\nthe precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault. Some have sought to\njustify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our Embassy in Cairo\nyesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the intemet. America's commitment\nto religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear \u2014 there is\nno justification for this, none. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long\nas there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a\ntrue and lasting peace.\nIt is especially difficult that this happened on September I I th. It's an anniversary that means a\ngreat deal to all Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet\nfinished, that the job of putting an end to violent extremism and building a safe and stable world\ncontinues. But September 11th means even more than that.

Doherty in Benghazi, Libya\nSeptember 13, 2012\nThe attack on our diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya on Tuesday claimed the lives of four\nAmericans. Yesterday, I spoke about two: Ambassador Chris Stevens and Information\nManagement Officer Sean Smith. Today, we also recognize the two security personnel who died\nhelping protect their colleagues. Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty were both decorated\nmilitary veterans who served our country with honor and distinction. Our thoughts, prayers, and\ndeepest gratitude are with their families and friends. Our embassies could not carry on our\ncritical work around the world without the service and sacrifice of brave people like Tyrone and\nGlen.\nTyrone's friends and colleagues called him \"Rone,\" and they relied on his courage and skill,\nhoned over two decades as a Navy SEAL. In uniform, he served multiple tours in Iraq and\nAfghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in dangerous posts from\nCentral America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well as the arm of a warrior,\nearning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. All our hearts go out to\nTyrone's wife Dorothy and his three sons, Tyrone Jr., Hunter, and Kai, who was born just a few\nmonths ago.\nWe also grieve for Glen Doherty, called Bub, and his family: his father Bernard, his mother\nBarbara, his brother Gregory, and his sister Kathleen. Glen was also a former Navy SEAL and an\nexperienced paramedic. And he put his life on the line many times, protecting Americans in Iraq,\nAfghanistan, and other hotspots. In the end, he died the way he lived \u2014 with selfless honor and\nunstinting valor.\nWe condemn the attack that took the lives of these heroes in the strongest terms, and we are\ntaking additional steps to safeguard American embassies, consulates, and citizens around the\nworld. This violence should shock the conscience of people of all faiths and traditions. We\nappreciate the statements of support that have poured in from across the region and beyond.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Well, let me welcome our friends and colleagues\nfrom Morocco here to the Benjamin Franklin Room on the eighth floor of the State Department\nfor this very important first session of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue. Before I begin to\naddress the significance of this Strategic Dialogue and the next step in our long relations with\nMorocco, I want to say a few words about the events unfolding in the world today.\nWe are closely watching what is happening in Yemen and elsewhere, and we certainly hope and\nexpect that there will be steps taken to avoid violence and prevent the escalation of protests into\nviolence.\nI also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to these\nprotests in a number of countries. Let me state very clearly \u2014 and I hope it is obvious \u2014 that the\nUnited States Government had absolutely nothing to do with this video. We absolutely reject its\ncontent and message. America's commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very\nbeginning of our nation. And as you know, we are home to people of all religions, many of\nwhom came to this country seeking the right to exercise their own religion, including, of course,\nmillions of Muslims. And we have the greatest respect for people of faith.\nTo us, to me personally, this video is disgusting and reprehensible. It appears to have a deeply\ncynical purpose: to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage. But as I said yesterday, there\nis no justification, none at all, for responding to this video with violence, We condemn the\nviolence that has resulted in the strongest terms, and we greatly appreciate that many Muslims in\nthe United States and around the world have spoken out on this issue.\nViolence, we believe, has no place in religion and is no way to honor religion. Islam, like other\nreligions, respects the fundamental dignity of human beings, and it is a violation of that\nfundamental dignity to wage attacks on innocents. As long as there are those who are willing to\nshed blood and take innocent life in the name of religion, the name of God, the world will never\nknow a true and lasting peace. It is especially wrong for violence to be directed against\ndiplomatic missions. These are places whose very purpose is peaceful: to promote better\nunderstuiding across countries and cultures. All governments have a responsibility to protect\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Now, I would\nnote that in today's world with today's technologies, that is impossible. But even if it were\npossible, our country does have a long tradition of free expression which is enshrined in our\nConstitution and our law, and we do not stop individual citizens from expressing their views no\nmatter how distasteful they may be.\nThere are, of course, different views around the world about the outer limits of free speech and\nfree expression, but there should be no debate about the simple proposition that violence in\nresponse to speech is not acceptable. We all \u2014 whether we are leaders in government, leaders in\ncivil society or religious leaders \u2014 must draw the line at violence. And any responsible leader\nshould be standing up now and drawing that line.\nI wanted to begin with this statement, because, as our Moroccan friends and all of you know, this\nhas been a difficult week at the State Department. I very much appreciate, Minister, the\ncondolences your government expressed to our Embassy in Rabat And even though that tragedy\nhappened far away in Benghazi, we found a reminder of the deep bounds that connect Morocco\nto the United States. It was in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco that one of the Americans\nwe lost this week, Ambassador Chris Stevens, fell in love with the region when he served as a\nPeace Corps volunteer there. That experience set him on a decades-long career of service. So in\nthe memory of fallen friends and colleagues, let us remind ourselves of the many ways in which\nriot just our governments but the people of our two nations have worked together to build a better\nfuture.\nIn many ways, the United States looks to Morocco to be a leader and a model. His Majesty King\nMohammed deserves great credit for the work you've undertaken. In fact, after my visit to Rabat\nearlier this year. I told my team: \"We need to start a Strategic Dialogue with Morocco.\" No\ncountry has been a friend of the United States longer than Morocco. You were the first nation to\nrecognize us back in 1777. But we're not satisfied with simply having a friendship that is\nlongstanding We want one that is dynamic, growing, looking toward the future. So let me\nhighlight a few of the areas we should focus on today.\nOn political reform, we have all seen remarkable changes taking place across North Africa and\nthe Middle East. I commend Morocco and your government for your efforts to stay ahead of\nthese changes by holding free and fair elections, empowering the elected parliament, taking other\nsteps to ensure that the government reflects the will of the people. Today, our political working\ngroup will discuss how the United States can continue to support your efforts to translate\ncommitments into actions. Because as we all know, democracy, real reform, require that people\nthemselves feel the changes in their evetyday lives: the courts reformed, the government more\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nopen and transparent, universal human rights of all Moroccans \u2014 men and women alike \u2014\nrespected.\nI'm especially pleased by Morocco's commitments to take on the deeply troubling problem of\nchild marriage. We know that child brides are less likely to get an education, more likely to face\nlife-threatening problems, particularly around child birth and delivery, which not only\nshortchanges them but can even rob them and their communities of their lives and talents. So we\nwant to encourage the government and civil society to continue their important work together on\nthis issue.\nWith regard to the Western Sahara, the United States continues to support efforts to find a\npeaceful, sustainable, mutually agreed-upon solution. U.S. policy toward the Western Sahara has\nremained consistent for many years. We have made clear that Morocco's autonomy plan is\nserious, realistic, and credible, and that it represents a potential approach that could satisfy the\naspirations of the people in the Western Sahara to run their own affairs in peace and dignity. We\ncontinue to support the negotiations carried out by the United Nations and hope parties can work\ntoward resolution.\nWith respect to the economy, our second working group will focus on what more can be done to\ndeliver tangible economic benefits. Morocco's economy is relatively healthy, but you face the\nsame problem that is now endemic across the world \u2014 unemployment is still too high, especially\namong young people.\nThat's why the United States is providing $1.5 million to support an effort to attract foreign\ninvestors, foster local economic development, and combat corruption across the region. And I'm\npleased to announce that later this year we will hold a Morocco business development\nconference here in Washington to connect businesses from both countries.\nToday, we should discuss ways to build on all of these efforts by increasing bilateral trade, a\nparticular goal of mine since so much trade from Morocco goes to Europe. I'd like to increase\nthe amount of trade coming to the United States, and also to improve economic integration\nacross North Africa, which could greatly benefit Morocco because of Morocco's stability and\nMorocco's very strong economic foundation. The greater integration there is, the greater the\nbenefits for Moroccans.\nThird, the attack in Benghazi this week reminds us that security remains a vital issue. Through\nour work together on the Global Counterterrorism Task Force, the United States and Morocco\nalready share crucial information and best practices, and I thank Morocco for hosting a Global\nCounterterrorism Task Force workshop on threats in the South Atlantic next month.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

And so we are\npartnering to help strengthen Morocco's criminal justice system and law enforcement.\nThere will be a lot to discuss in the meeting today. And let me add, the United States greatly\nappreciates the constructive role Morocco is playing on the UN Security Council, especially your\nsupport for the effort to end the violence and bloodshed in Syria and help to usher in a new\ndemocratic future for that country. I commend Morocco for offering to host the next ministerial\nmeeting of the Friends of the Syrian People, and we look forward to continuing to work closely\ntogether as close partners even after your term on the Security Council has ended.\nFinally, our education and cultural ties are reason for much celebration. This year marks the 30th\nanniversary of our official program to facilitate academic exchanges and other bonds between us.\nThere are more than 5,000 Moroccan alumni of these programs. Two are with us today \u2014 Dr.\nBenjelloun and Dr. Ouaouicha \u2014 and we thank them. But among all our work on this front, from\npreserving Morocco's historic sites to empowering youth, there's one area I particularly hope we\ncan focus on today and receive your advice and counsel \u2014 namely, interfaith dialogue.\nIn these tense and turbulent times, it's more important than ever for people of different faiths to\nexchange ideas, to build understanding, to promote religious tolerance. It's one of the great\nchallenges of the 21st century, and it's one that we must address together.\nSo we have a lot of work to do, Minister, but our friendship runs long and deep, and as the treaty\nour nations signed in 1786 says, and I quote, \"Trusting in God, it will remain permanent.\" I'm\nconfident that we will continue to solve problems and produce results that make our nations\nstronger, more peaceful, more secure, more prosperous, and also contribute to doing the same for\nthe world.\nSo again, let me welcome you, Minister. It's been a great pleasure for me to get to know you, to\nwork with you, to be your colleague bilaterally, regionally, and globally, and also welcome your\ndistinguished delegation.\nThank you.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nTonight, our gathering is more somber than any of us would like. This comes during sad and\ndifficult days for the State Department family. We lost four Americans. They were good and\nbrave men. They were committed to the cause of building a brighter future for the people of\nLibya. And we condemn the violence in the strongest terms, the violence against our posts in\nBenghazi, in Egypt, and now in Yemen.\nThe Libyan ambassador is with us tonight, and I want to take a moment to thank him for the\nsupport that his government and the Libyan people have shown to the United States in this\ntragedy, particularly the outpouring of feelings of grief and loss because of the killing of our\nambassador.\nAmbassador Aujali, would you mind saying a few words?\nAMBASSADOR AMU: [redacted]\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Ambassador. I know that that was a very\npersonal loss for you, as it was for me. I'm the one who sent Chris to Benghazi during the\nrevolution to show support and be able to advise our government about what we could do to\nbring freedom and democracy and opportunity to the people of Libya.\nReligious freedom and religious tolerance are essential to the stability of any nation, any people.\nHatred and violence in the name of religion only poison the well. All people of faith and good\nwill know that the actions of a small and savage group in Benghazi do not honor religion or God\nin any way. Nor do they speak for the more than one billion Muslims around the world, many of\nwhom have shown an outpouring of support during this time\nUnfortunately, however, over the last 24 hours, we have also seen violence spread elsewhere.\nSome seek to justify this behavior as a response to inflammatory, despicable material posted on\nthe intemet. As I said earlier today, the United States rejects both the content and the message of\nthat video. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of\nothers. At our meeting earlier today, my colleague, the foreign minister of Morocco, said that all\nprophets should be respected because they are all symbols of our humanity, for all humanity.\nBut both of us were crystal clear in this paramount message: There is never any justification for\nviolent acts of this kind. And we look to leaders around the world to stand up and speak out\nagainst violence, and to take steps to protect diplomatic missions from attack.\nThink about it. When Christians are subject to insults to their faith, and that certainly happens,\nwe expect them not to resort to violence. When Hindus or Buddhists are subjected to insults to\ntheir faiths, and that also certainly happens, we expect them not to resort to violence. The same\ngoes for all faiths, including Islam.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nWhen all of us who are people of faith - and I am one \u2014 feel the pain of insults, of\nmisunderstanding, of denigration to what we cherish, we must expect ourselves and others not to\nresort to violence, That is a universal standard and expectation, and it is everyone's obligation to\nmeet that, so that we make no differences, we expect no less of ourselves than we expect of\nothers, You cannot respond to offensive speech with violence without begetting more violence.\nAnd I so strongly believe that the great religions of the world are stronger than any insults. They\nhave withstood offense for centuries. Refraining from violence, then, is not a sign of weakness in\none's faith; it is absolutely the opposite, a sign that one's faith is unshakable.\nSo tonight, we must come together and recommit ourselves to working toward a future marked\nby understanding and acceptance rather than distrust, hatred, and fear. We can pledge that\nwhenever one person speaks out in ignorance and bigotry, ten voices will answer. They will\nanswer resoundingly against the offense and the insult, answering ignorance with enlightenment,\nanswering hatred with understanding, answering darkness with light; that if one person commits\na violent act in the name of religion, millions will stand up and condemn it out of strength.\nIn times like these, it can be easy to despair that some differences are irreconcilable, some\nmountains too steep to climb; we will therefore never reach the level of understanding and\npeacefulness that we seek, and which I believe the great religions of the world call us to pursue.\nBut that's not what I believe, and I don't think it's what you believe either here tonight. Part of\nwhat makes our country so special is we keep trying. We keep working. We keep investing in\nour future. We keep supporting the next generation, believing that young people can keep us\nmoving forward in a positive direction.\nSo tonight I think it's important that we talk not just about that better tomorrow that we all seek,\nbut also about some of the things \u2014 the real, practical, tangible things \u2014 that young people are\ndoing to help shape that better future.\nTwo years ago in this room, at our Eid reception, we launched a program called Generation\nChange to lead a grassroots agenda of positive engagement with Muslim communities. And I\nasked the young Muslim leaders in the audience that night to be our unofficial ambassadors, to\nhelp build personal connections, seek out partners in other countries. And I can report to you\ntonight they did not disappoint. In a few minutes, you're going to meet some of these young\nleaders, each with a powerful story to tell.\nThe Generation Change network that started in this room now circles the globe. We are building\nan international alliance of young people who want to drive change in their own communities.\nThey act as mentors, spark respectful debates, simply offer words of encouragement when\nneeded. But most importantly, they inspire others to keep expanding the circle of mutual\nunderstanding and respect, one person at a time.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Our 2012 Hours Against Hate initiative encourages\nyoung people to put themselves in another person's shoes through service projects. So far, young\npeople from all over the world have pledged thousands of volunteer hours to help people from a\ndifferent background, to see them as a fellow human being, not a stereotype, not a caricature, but\nanother real live person \u2014 people who don't look like you, live like you, pray like you, but with\nwhom we will share this planet. And therefore, we have work to do.\nPeople of faith and conscience are called to be the leaders of tolerance. In my tradition, like all\ntraditions, we are expected to love one another. And together, we have to translate that into better\nunderstanding and cooperation. I'm particularly pleased that the young people you will hear from\ntonight are really setting an example, not only for young people elsewhere in the world but,\nfrankly, for us who are older as well.\nLet me now call to the stage someone who has been a tremendous assistance to me in these\nefforts. Farah Pandith is the Department's first Special Representative to Muslim Communities.\nAnd from the beginning, she has made reaching out to young people and civil society her top\npriority.

Our thoughts and prayers are with Glen's father Bernard, his\nmother Barbara, his brother Gregory, his sister Kathleen, and their grieving families, friends, and\ncolleagues.\nI was honored to know Ambassador Chris Stevens. I want to thank his parents and siblings, who\nare here today, for sharing Chris with us and with our country. What a wonderful gift you gave\nus. Over his distinguished career in the Foreign Service, Chris won friends for the United States\nin far-flung places. He made those people's hopes his own. During the revolution in Libya, he\nrisked his life to help protect the Libyan people from a tyrant, and he gave his life helping them\nbuild a better country.\nPeople loved to work with Chris. And as he rose through the ranks, they loved to work for Chris.\nHe was known not only for his courage but for his smile \u2014 goofy but contagious \u2014 for his sense\nof fun and that California cool.\nIn the days since the attack, so many Libyans \u2014 including the Ambassador from Libya to the\nUnited States, who is with us today \u2014 have expressed their sorrow and solidarity. One young\nwoman, her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness, held up a handwritten sign that said\n\"Thugs and killers don't represent Benghazi nor Islam,\" The President of the Palestinian\nAuthority, who worked closely with Chris when he served in Jerusalem, sent me a letter\nremembering his energy and integrity, and deploring \u2014 and I quote \u2014 \"an act of ugly terror.\"\nMany others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments.\nThis has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We've seen the\nheavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We've seen rage\nand violence directed at American embassies over an awful interne video that we had nothing to\ndo with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because it is senseless, and it is\ntotally unacceptable.\nThe people of Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the\ntyranny of a mob. Reasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do\neverything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts. And\nwe will, under the President's leadership, keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the\nworld.\nThere will be more difficult days ahead, but it is important that we don't lose sight of the\nfundamental fact that America must keep leading the world. We owe it to those four men to\ncontinue the long, hard work of diplomacy. I am enormously proud of the men and women of the\nState Department.

If the last few days teach us anything, let\nit be this: That this work and the men and women who risk their lives to do it are at the heart of\nwhat makes America great and good.\nSo we will wipe away our tears, stiffen our spines, and face the future undaunted. And we will\ndo it together, protecting and helping one another, just like Sean, Tyrone, Glen, and Chris always\ndid. May God bless them and grant their families peace and solace, and may God continue to\nbless the United States of America.\nAnd now, let me have the great honor of introducing someone who came to the State Department\nearlier this week to grieve with us. He well understands and values the work that these men were\ndoing for our country. The President of the United States.\nRemarks With Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Patricia Espinosa After Their\nMeeting\nSeptember 18, 2012\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it is such a pleasure for me to\nwelcome my friend and colleague, Secretary Espinosa, along with a very distinguished\ndelegation of officials from the Mexican Government for this continuation of consultation at the\nhighest levels of each of our governments.\nBefore I turn to the matters discussed today, let me give a brief update on the ongoing U.S.\nresponse to the protests in the Middle East and elsewhere. I'm sure as you know already, we are\ntaking aggressive steps to protect our staffs in embassies and consulates worldwide. That\nincludes reviewing our security posture at every post and augmenting it where necessary. And\nwe are working closely with the Libyan Government in our efforts to bring to justice those who\nmurdered our four American colleagues in Benghazi.\nThe FBI is now in Tripoli to join the investigation with Libyan officials, and there is nothing\nmore important to us than ensuring the safety of our American representatives worldwide. At the\nsame time, as I have said to State Department employees, the incidents of the past week highlight\nhow important our work is. The United States must and will remain strongly engaged in the\nworld. Our men and women risk their lives in service to our country and our values, because they\nknow that the United States must be a force for peace and progress. That is worth striving and\nsacrificing for, and nothing that happened last week changes this fundamental fact.\nNow, turning to our friends and partners in Mexico, we are always pleased to have a chance to\ndiscuss matters of mutual interest and concern between us. Mexico is one of our closest friends\nas well as partner on dozens of critical issues. So we talk about every kind of issue you can\nimagine, from education and healthcare to poverty alleviation to the environment. But today, we\nfocused on a top priority for us both a security.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nWe just co-chaired the fourth meeting of the U.S.-Mexico Merida High-Level Consultative\nGroup. This is the last one we will hold during the Calderon Administration. And I want to offer\nmy personal appreciation to President Calderon and to Foreign Secretary Espinosa for their\nleadership and commitment to this partnership and to all on both sides of the border in our\ngovernments who have been deeply engaged and committed to it. The Merida Initiative\nrepresents an unprecedented level of security cooperation between Mexico and the United States.\nAs our countries continue to deal with the serious challenge of transnational criminal\norganizations, including drug traffickers, illegal arms traffickers, money launderers, and violent\ngangs that threaten people on both sides of the border, we well know there is no quick and easy\nway to stop these criminals and bring them to justice. But nevertheless, during the past now\nnearly four years, our countries have collaborated to an extraordinary and unprecedented degree.\nWe have brought together policy makers and experts from across our governments and societies\nwho have worked hand in hand to keep our people safe. And I think the habits of cooperation we\nhave built are among our most important achievements, and we will rely on them for a long time\nto come.\nToday, our delegations reviewed the gains we've made on key priorities, including improving\nlaw enforcement coordination, reducing the demand for drugs, modernizing our border\ninfrastructure, strengthening the rule of law, and building more resilient and empowered\ncommunities. We also discussed the lessons we've learned and the work that lies ahead in these\nand other areas, which our joint statement will reflect. I want to underscore how important our\nsecurity relationship with Mexico is to the United States.\nThe Government of Mexico and the Mexican people have faced the threat posed by these\ncriminals with courage and resolve, and we remain committed to doing everything we can to\nsupport Mexico as it continues to work to bring those criminals to justice. This is a transnational\nproblem, and it calls for a transnational solution, and the United States believes this is a matter of\nshared responsibility. That was the first message I brought as Secretary of State when I came to\nMexico, and it continues to be the hallmark of our efforts together. Making sure our people are\nsafe and our neighbors are safe is of the utmost importance to us.\nNow, our two countries share many other priorities, and one of them, empowering women and\ngirls, was also addressed today. We took the opportunity, the Foreign Secretary and I, to sign a\nMemorandum of Understanding between our countries to work together to advance gender\nequality, empower girls and women, promote their human rights, and enhance their security.\nSo again, Secretary Espinosa, let me thank you for years of work and effort, for our productive\nconversations in many places around the world and again today, and for being such a valuable\ncolleague and partner. The United States deeply, deeply values our relationship with Mexico and\nthe ties of family and friendship that connect so many millions of our people.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

We believe strongly that presidential administrations may\nchange, elections will come and go, but we have established a firm foundation for cooperation\nthat has already benefited both our countries and which will continue to benefit both of our\ncountries for many years ahead. So thank you very much.\nMS. NULAND: We'll take (inaudible). Margaret Brennan, CBS News.\nQUESTION: Madam Secretary, thanks for your time. Are you any closer to finding who killed\nAmbassador Chris Stevens?, Libya's President says this attack was planned for months. Are you\nconfident he's wrong and that security measures were appropriate? And will you leave justice to\nthe Libyans?\nSECRETARY CLINTON: As I said at the outset, we are taking aggressive steps to protect our\npeople and our consulates and embassies around the world. We are reviewing our security\nposture at every post and working with host governments to be sure they know what our security-\nneeds are wherever necessary. We are also working closely with the Libyan Government to bring\nthe perpetrators to justice so that we can be assured that we have found who murdered our four,\ncolleagues and under what circumstances. As I said, the FBI has joined the investigation inside\nLibya, and we will not rest until the people who orchestrated this attack are found and punished.\nIt is also important to look at this strategically and understand what is going on across the region.\nIn a number of places where protests have tuned violent, we are seeing the hand of extremists\nwho are trying to exploit people's inflamed passions for their own agendas. But overwhelmingly,\nwe have found that the people of Egypt, of Libya, of Yemen and Tunisia are not prepared to\ntrade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob. They want to turn their attention to the\nfuture to provide better opportunities for themselves and their children, and they want a strong\npartnership with the United States and the American people based on mutual interests and mutual\nrespect.\nThis is part of a larger debate that is going on inside these societies. In Libya, for example, in\ntheir first free elections, moderates were successful at the polls. But look, there are extremists in\nall of these societies and on the outside who are working to take advantage of broad outrage in\norder to incite violence and specifically incite violence against Americans and American\nfacilities.\nAnd as I have said to many of the leaders I have spoken to over the past week, these extremist\nefforts are a threat to the people of the societies and the governments of those societies as well as\nto the region and the United States. And I think it's important at this moment for leaders to put\nthemselves on the right side of this debate - to speak out clearly and unequivocally against\nviolence, whoever incites it or conducts it\nAnd in a struggle like this, there can be no doubt where the United States must stand. We support\nthose who are fighting for the same values and rights that we believe in - in democracy, in\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

And I want to\nunderscore that the United States will continue to work with partners and allies in the region and\naround the world to help bring security to these nations so that the promise of the revolutions that\nthey experienced can be realized.\nAnd finally, on your specific point about Benghazi, we obviously never talk publicly about\nsecurity at any of our missions for obvious reasons. But that said, let me assure you that our\nsecurity in Benghazi included a unit of host government security forces, as well as a local guard\nforce of the kind that we rely on in many places around the world. In addition to the security\noutside the compound, we relied on a wall and a robust security presence inside the compound.\nAnd with all of our missions overseas, in advance of September lid', as is done every year, we\ndid an evaluation on threat streams. And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has\nsaid we had no actionable intelligence that an attack on our post in Benghazi was planned or\nimminent.\nBut let me state the obvious again. Our diplomats engage in dangerous work, and it's the nature\nof diplomacy in fragile societies and conflict zones to be aware of the necessity for security but\nto also continue the important diplomatic work that has to go on. There is risk inherent in what\nwe do and what these brave men and women representing the United States are up against every\nsingle day, and we do our very best to limit that risk by ensuring that our security protocols\nreflect the environments in which diplomats work and the threats that they are presented with.\nThank you.\nRemarks With Indonesian Foreign Minister Raden Mohammad Marty Muliana\nNatalegawa After Their Meeting\nSeptember 20, 2012\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it's such a pleasure, as always, to\nwelcome the Indonesian Foreign Minister, and I believe the largest delegation that has ever come\nfrom Indonesia, for the purpose of our third meeting of the U.S.-Indonesia Joint Commission.\nThis commission is the result of a vision by our two presidents for a comprehensive partnership,\nand the agreement to that effect was signed in 2010. Thanks to this partnership, the United States\nand Indonesia are working more closely than ever on a range of issues from global security to\nclean energy and climate to regional trade and commerce.\nAnd today, Marty and I had the chance to take stock of where our teams have come in the time\nof the last year, because we liad our meeting in Bali a year ago. And I must say, I was very\nimpressed. We covered a great deal today.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nBut before I start, I'd like to say a few words about the protests in several countries around the\nworld. We have condemned in the strongest possible terms the violence that has erupted from\nthese protests. And as I have said, the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and\nreprehensible, and the United States Government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it.\nBut there is no justification for violence, and I want to thank the Foreign Minister and his\ngovernment for speaking out against violence. We have to look to reasonable people and\nresponsible leaders everywhere to stand up to extremists who would seek to take advantage of\nthis moment to commit violent acts against embassies and their fellow countrymen.\nToday's meetings have highlighted the strong foundation that we have built together. And one of\nour most important concerns is promoting peace and stability in the Asia Pacific. Today, I'm\nannouncing that the Obama Administration has informed Congress of the potential sale of eight\nAH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters to the Indonesian Government. This agreement will\nstrengthen our comprehensive partnership and help enhance security across the region.\nOn growth and prosperity, we are increasing our trade relationship that topped $26 billion last\nyear. Investments in transportation, energy, and infrastructure are creating jobs and supporting\neconomic growth in both countries. For example, the deal between Lion Air and Boeing alone\nrepresents $21 billion in trade over the next decade. Indonesia's Government has announced half\na trillion dollars in infrastructure improvements, and we recently signed a memorandum of\nunderstanding to make it easier for American companies to bid on these projects.\nAnd yesterday, we signed an agreement for implementing our Millennium Challenge\nCorporation Compact with Indonesia. Over the next five years, the United States will invest $600\nmillion in clean energy development, child health and nutrition programs, and efforts to help\nmake Indonesia's Government more transparent and open.\nThe United States is also looking forward to Indonesia hosting APEC in 2013, and we are\nconfident that Indonesia will come to this role with a commitment to promote greater economic\nintegration across the Asia Pacific.\nBoth the Foreign Minister and I believe that strong education is essential to compete in a modem\nglobal economy. That's why the United States has expanded the Fulbright Program and\nsupported partnerships between dozens of American and Indonesian universities. Academic\nexchanges between our countries are up and applications from Indonesian students to visit the\nUnited States have increased by one third. USAID has recently expanded its basic education\nprogram to provide $83 million for teacher training and literacy programs for young children.\nAnd we're providing $20 in scholarship funding for Indonesian graduate students.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

The Foreign Minister's\npersonal leadership has helped lay the groundwork for diplomacy between ASEAN and China as\nit relates to the South China Sea. And we continue to support ASEAN's six-point principles,\nwhich we believe will help reduce tensions and pave the way for a comprehensive code of\nconduct for addressing disputes without threats, coercion, or use of force.\nFinally. Indonesia and the United States have stood together on a range of global challenges,\nfrom democratic reform in Burma to combating climate change, to working to end the violence\nin Syria. We are also coordinating efforts to further develop south-south and triangular\ncooperation, such as enhancing disaster preparedness in Burma and convening a conference on\nwomen's empowerment.\nWe believe that as the second and third-largest democracies in the world, the United States and\nIndonesia have a special responsibility to promote democracy and human rights. And for the last\nfour years, Indonesia has hosted the Bali Democracy Forum to promote peaceful, democratic\ntransitions through example and open dialogue. Last year, more than 80 countries attended. And\nonce again, the United States will be sending a high-level delegation.\nSo, Minister, thank you for everything. Thank you for the great partnership we've had between\nus and between our countries.\nMS. NULAND: We'll take two questions today, we'll start with Ros Jordan of Al Jazeera\nEnglish.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Madam Secretary, Mr. Foreign Minister. Madam Secretary, my\nquestion is about the ongoing investigation into last week's attack at the consulate in Benghazi.\nYou are meeting this afternoon with members of Congress to discuss the progress and the\nconcerns that they understandably have. First, there is the federal mandate to establish an\naccountability review board. Have you done so? Who would you like to see chair it? Are there\ncertain questions that you desperately want to have answered in order to safeguard the safety of\nForeign Service Officers around the world?\nAnd related to this, given the political instability and the successes of the past year and a half, are\nyou satisfied that in light of those political changes, enough was done to protect those working in\nthe Middle East and North Africa? And then finally \u2014 and this is perhaps going into the area of\nrumor and speculation \u2014 but there is at least one report suggesting that Ambassador Stevens felt\nthat he was on a, quote, \"al-Qaida hit list\" Is this a scurrilous rumor? Is this gallows humor\nwhen one is working in a period of difficulty and great challenge, or is there something more to\nwhat he allegedly \u2014 and I stress that word \u2014 said?\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

I will be briefing in two separate sessions, the House and the Senate, in\na classified setting, along with my interagency colleagues, as we continue to work together, and\nwith governments around the world, to ensure that our people and our facilities are safe. I will be\njoined today by the Director of National Intelligence, General Clapper, by the Deputy Secretary\nof Defense, Ash Carter, by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Sandy Winnefeld,\nalong with experts from the FBI, the State Department, and elsewhere in the government.\nNow, I anticipate that this briefing will cover our security posture before and during the events,\nand the steps we have taken since to do everything we can with host governments to protect our\npeople and our embassies and consulates. The Director of National Intelligence will speak to the\nintelligence issues surrounding these events in Libya. Deputy Secretary Carter will brief on the\nsuperb support we have had from the U.S. military in the wake of these events, and we are at the\nvery early stages of an FBI investigation. The team from the FBI reached Libya earlier this week.\nAnd I will advise Congress also that I am launching an accountability review board that will be\nchaired by Ambassador Thomas Pickering.\nI will also talk about the importance of the broader relationships with these countries in light of\nthe events of the past days. There are obviously very real challenges in these new democracies,\nthese fragile societies, but as I said last week, the vast majority of the people in these countries\ndid not throw off the tyranny of a dictator to trade it for the tyranny of a mob. And we are\nconcerned first and foremost with our own people and facilities, but we are concerned about the\ninternal security in these countries because ultimately, that puts at risk the men, women, and\nchildren of these societies on a daily ongoing basis if actions are not taken to try to restore\nsecurity and civil order.\nAnd let me just conclude by saying that there can be no doubt where the United States stands.\nWe continue to support those who are fighting for universal values \u2014 values that we see at work\nin Indonesia \u2014 the third largest democracy in the world. We believe that these values of universal\nrights, of justice and accountability, of democracy, are there for every person regardless of where\nthat person might live. So I will look forward to having a chance to talk with members of\nCongress.\nAs to your final question, I have absolutely no information or reason to believe that there's any\nbasis for that.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMS. NULAND: Last question. Victoria Sidjabat from Tempo Magazine, please.\nQUESTION: Yes. Madam, thank you.

If it's continuing happen, it's \u2014\nobviously could give impact to the implementation of (inaudible) program in Indonesia. What is\nthe reason U.S. Government closed the Embassy and Consulate in Indonesia? What is your\nexpectation from Indonesia Government, for my Minister Marty Natalegawa? How Indonesia\nGovernment respond to the closing of this Embassy and Consulate, it's starting today? Is U.S. \u2014\nIndonesia Government has capability to protect U.S. Embassy and Consulate. So the (inaudible)\nprogram implemented \u2014 could be implemented successfully in Indonesia. Thank you.\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Well, let me begin by saying how grateful we are for the excellent\ncooperation we have received from the Government of Indonesia, and in particular, from the law\nenforcement and security institutions in Indonesia. We are very grateful for not only the\ncooperation and protection that has been provided to our facilities, but also to the strong\nstatements condemning violence from the President, the Foreign Mihister, and others.\nIn consultation with the Government of Indonesia, we have temporarily, for tomorrow, closed\nour facilities. We want to be sure that law enforcement in Indonesia has the ability to do what it\nneeds to do to make sure that there is no disruption of civil order and security. So we are\ncooperating completely, and we're very grateful for the strong leadership provided by Indonesia.\nFOREIGN MINISTER NATALEGAWA: Hello, (inaudible), if I may just also respond.\nPrecisely as the Secretary had said, the decision by the United States Government to close\ntemporarily its embassies and consulates tomorrow in Indonesia is a decision that's been made\nbased on communication and conversation between the authorities in Indonesia and the United\nStates as well. So in other words, it is an informed decision, a decision that is not intended to\nshow any unfriendly intent on the part of anyone, but it is what it is, and it's quite some \u2014 it's the\nkind of step that governments actually carry out when situations requires it, even in our case.\nSome of our embassies abroad, when the situation requires us to have a temporary closing of the\nembassy, we do that as well. So it is something that is quite regular and something that is\nactually coordinated as well.\nBut if I may just broaden the subject matter, I think as our President had said in the past,\nIndonesian Government the Indonesian people, even, obviously cannot and would not condone\nthe \u2014 any acts of violence against diplomatic premises, against diplomatic personnel, because\nthat is, truly \u2014 would be a challenge to the efficient and a proper conduct of relations among\nstates. So that's our point of departure.\nAt the same time, of course, beyond the immediate issue of protection of the embassies, we have\nstill ahead of us the challenge of how to prevent the kind of situations where we are now at in\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

We've had the opportunity to meet in Islamabad and other\nsettings, but I am very pleased that we would have this chance to exchange views on our bilateral\nrelationship as well as regional and global issues.\nI want to begin by addressing the events of the day and the past week. Today, we've once again\nseen protests in several cities in Pakistan. Unfortunately, some of those protests have turned\nviolent and, sadly, resulted in loss of life. I want to thank the Government of Pakistan for their\nefforts to protect our Embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Lahore, Peshawar, and Karachi.\nAnd I want to be clear, as I have said on numerous occasions, the violence we have seen cannot\nbe tolerated. There is no justification for violence. Of course, there is provocation, and we have\ncertainly made clear that we do not in any way support provocation. We found the video that's at\nthe core of this series of events offensive, disgusting, reprehensible.\nBut that does not provide justification for violence, and therefore it is important for responsible\nleaders, indeed responsible people everywhere, to stand up and speak out against violence and\nparticularly against those who would exploit this difficult moment to advance their own\nextremist ideologies.\nYesterday afternoon when I briefed the Congress, I made it clear that keeping our people\neverywhere in the world safe is our top priority. What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist\nattack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who\nmurdered four Americans. And we are taking aggressive measures at all of our posts to protect\nour staffs and their families along with locally employed people who provide so many important\ncontributions to the work of our missions.\nThe Foreign Minister and I will have a chance to cover a full range of subjects today, and it is no\nsecret that the past year and a half has been challenging for Pakistan and the United States. And\nwe still have work to do to get our bilateral relationship to the point where we would like it to be,\nbut we both recognize that we can achieve more when we work together on a focused agenda.

I look forward to seeing President Zardari next week\nat the UN General Assembly. At each meeting, we are working to identify the strategic goals we\nshare \u2014 and there are many \u2014 and the concrete actions we can each take to accomplish them.\nOur number one shared priority remains pursuing our joint counterterrorism objectives to ensure\nthe security of American and Pakistani citizens alike. We face a common threat from a common\nenemy, and we must confront terrorism and extremism together. Earlier this month, I designated\nthe Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization so we could make full use of every\navailable legal authority to end their deadly attacks. Pakistan's parliament has called for\nexpelling foreign fighters so that Pakistan's territory can be fully under control of the Pakistani\nGovernment and cannot be used to launch attacks against other nations.\nAnd the follow-through on this is challenging but necessary, and we look forward to working\nwith Pakistan as they continue to address these problems. We have both pledged to support a\nsecure, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan, which is vital for the security of the region. And I\nwant to thank Foreign Minister Khar for Pakistan's reopening of the NATO supply lines to allow\nthe movement of goods to Afghanistan.\nWe will discuss the successful first meeting of the Safe Passage Working Group in Islamabad\nwhich brought together Afghan, Pakistani, and U.S. representatives to advance the peace process\nin Afghanistan. The Pakistani Government's public call for insurgents to come forward and talk\nwith the Afghan Government was particularly important. We are ready to work together to build\non these steps, and we will continue our discussions through bilateral consultations and the U.S.-\nAfghanistan-Pakistan Core Group.\nNow, of course, our relationship goes far beyond our shared security concerns, and today we will\ndiscuss the many other ways in which we work together, particularly to create economic\nopportunity for Pakistanis. Foreign Minister Khar and I agree that we need to shift our economic\nrelationship from aid to trade and investment. We are working to help Pakistan attract more\nprivate sector investment. We hope to finalize a bilateral investment treaty soon. And we've\ncreated a Pakistan private investment initiative to help more of Pakistan's small and medium\nsized companies get access to capital.\nOver the past few years, we have seen Pakistan's civilian government begin to put down stronger\nroots. And if elections proceed as planned next year, it will mark the first time in Pakistan's\nhistory that a civilian-led government has served its full term. The United States supports\nPakistan's economic development, and we have said many times that we want to see democracy\nsucceed in Pakistan.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

I am pleased to welcome the Foreign Minister from\nTunisia I'm looking forward to our meeting, We obviously have a great deal to discuss, and I\nwant to thank the Foreign Minister and the Government of Tunisia for their efforts over the last\nweek to help secure our Embassy and the American Cooperative School of Tunis following the\nviolent assaults of last Friday.\nWe are monitoring events closely today. There is no higher priority for President Obama and\nmyself than the safety of our people. We've taken a number of steps around the world to\naugment security and to protect our personnel at diplomatic posts. And we are working closely\nwith host governments in this effort.\nAs I have said before and as is embodied in the Vienna Convention and other international\nagreements, all governments have the duty, the solemn duty, to defend diplomatic missions.\nThey must be safe and protected places so that governments can exchange views and work on\nmany important issues, and leaders across the world must stand up and be counted in rejecting\nviolence and holding violent actors accountable.\nWe are working closely with the Government of Tunisia They have assisted us in enhancing the\nsecurity of our facilities. We've also discussed with them the imperative of bringing to justice\nthose responsible for these violent attacks. And we have offered and will continue to look for\nways that we can assist the new Government of Tunisia in ensuring the rule of law throughout\ntheir country, first and foremost for the people of Tunisia themselves. We look forward to\ncontinuing to build our hew partnership with the Tunisian Government and people. Our\nrelationship is built around the shared principles of all democracies \u2014 a commitment to\nnonviolence, to tolerance, and inclusivity for all people, and to upholding the rule of law.\nThe Tunisian people have bravely put themselves on the road to democracy. They were the first\nof the Arab revolutions and they have made important progress in a very short period of time.\nThey have worked too hard and sacrificed too much over too many years to see their progress\nhijacked at derailed by extremists with Ulric own a5,-.\n,\n,encia.

AM\nAnne-Marie Slaughter is a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton.\nBy Anne-Marie Slaughter\nPRESIDENT Obama says the noose is tightening around Col. Muammar al-Qaddafi. In fact, it is\ntightening around the Libyan rebels, as Colonel Qaddafi makes the most of the world's dithering and\nsteadily retakes rebel-held tow.ns, The United States and Europe are temporizing on a no-flight zone\nwhile the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Gulf Cooperation Council and now the Arab\nLeague have all called on the United Nations Security Council to authorize one. Opponents of a no-\nflight zone have put forth five main arguments, none of which, on closer examination, hold up.\nIt's not in our interest. Gen. Wesley K. Clark argues that \"Libya doesn't sell much oil to the United\nStates\" and that while Americans \"want to support democratic movements in the region,\" they are\nalready doing that in Iraq and Afghanistan. Framing this issue in terms of oil is exactly what Arab\npopulations and indeed much of the world expect, which is why they are so cynical about our\nprofessions of support for democracy and human rights. Now we have a chance to support a new\nbeginning in the Muslim world \u2014 a new beginning of accountable governments that can provide\nservices and opportunities for their citizens in ways that could dramatically decrease support for\nterrorist groups and violent extremism. It's hard to imagine something more in our strategic interest.\nIt will be counter-productive. Many thoughtful commentators, including Al Jazeera's director\ngeneral, Wadah Khanfar, argue that what is most important about the Arab spring is that it is coming\nfrom Arabs themselves. From this perspective, Western military intervention will play right into\nQaddati's hands, allowing him to broadcast pictures of Western bombs falling on Arab civilians. But\nthese arguments, while important, must be weighed against the appeals of of Libyan opposition\nfighters asking for international help, and now, astonishingly, against support for a no-flight zone by\nsome of the same governments that have kept their populations quiescent by holding up the specter of\nforeign intervention. Assuming that a no-flight zone can be imposed by an international coalition that\nincludes Arab states, we have an opportunity to establish a new narrative of Western support for Arab\ndemocrats.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739568\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nIt won't work. The United States ambassador to NATO, Ivo H. Daaider, argues that stopping\nColonel Qaddafi's air force will not be decisive; he will continue to inflict damage with tanks and\nhelicopters, bombing oil refineries and depots on his way to retaking key towns. But the potential\neffect of a no-flight zone must also be assessed in terms of Colonel Qaddafi's own calculations about\nhis future. Richard Downie of the Center for Strategic and International Studies argues that although\nColonel Qaddafi cultivates a mad-dictator image, he has been a canny survivor and political\nmanipulator for 40 years. He is aware of debates with regard to a no-flight zone and is timing his\nmilitary campaign accordingly; he is also capable of using his air force just enough to gain strategic\nadvantage, but not enough to trigger a no-flight zone. If the international community lines up against\nhim and is willing to crater his runways and take out his antiaircraft weapons, he might well renew his\noffer of a negotiated departure.\nIf it does work, we don't know what we will get. Revolutions are almost always followed by internal\ndivisions among the revolutionaries. We should not expect a rosy, Jeffersonian Libya. But the choice\nis between uncertainty and the certainty that if Colonel Qaddafi wins, regimes acrosS the region will\nconclude that force is the livay to answer protests. And when Colonel Qaddafi massacres the\nopposition, young protesters across the Middle East will conclude that when we were asked to support\ntheir cause with more than words, we blinked. Americans in turn will read the words of Mr. Obama's\nJune 2009 speech in Cairo., with its lofty promises to stand for universal human rights, and cringe.\nLet's arm the rebels instead. Some commentators who agree with the analysis above say we could\n'better accomplish our goals by providing intelligence and arms to the opposition. That would, of\ncourse, be much easier for us. It undoubtedly appeals to Mn Obama as a neat compromise between\nthe desire to help the protesters and the desire not to overrule his defense secretary's reluctance to\nparticipate in a no-flight zone. But we would be providing arms not to a disciplined military, but to\nragged groups of brave volunteers who barely know how to use the weapons they have. They need\naction that will change the situation on. the ground for Colonel Qaddafi, as well as his the calculations.\nMoreover, by the time arms and intelligence could take effect, it is quite likely that Colonel Qaddafi\nwill have retaken or at least besieged .Benghazi, the opposition stronghold.\nThe United States should immediately ask the Security Council to authorize a no-flight zOne and\nmake clear to Russia and China that if they block the resolution, the blood of the Libyan opposition\nwill be on their hands. We should push them at least to abstain and bring the issue to a vote as soon as\npossible. If we get a resolution, we should work with the Arab League to quickly assemble an\ninternational coalition to impose the no-flight zone. If the Security Council fails toact, then we should\nrecognize the opposition Interim National Council as the legitimate Libyan government, as France has\ndone, and work with the Arab League to give the council any assistance it requests:\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739568\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

While conflict is a constant in human\nhistory, the nature of armed conflict, and especially the nature of 21st-century warfare, has been\ntransformed. General Rupert Smith identified these changes in his book The Utility of Force:\n\"The ends for which we fight are changing; we fight amongst the people; our conflicts tend to\nbe timeless; we fight so as not to lose the force; on each occasion new uses are found for old\nweapons; the sides are mostly non-state.\"2\nThe nature of 21st-century diplomacy is also changing. To be successful, diplomats must\nsimultaneously shape, act upon, and react to global challenges. As Hans Binnendijk and\nRichard Kugler of the National Defense University argue, no single problem, danger, or threat\nholds the key to the world's future. What matters is their interaction and the simultaneity of our\nresponses.3\nThe definition of victory, too, is different today. Twenty-first-century national security success\nwill encompass a comprehensive definition of security, and will be achieved by the broadest\nsimultaneous application of all elements of national power. This is the key to understanding\nPhilip Bobbitt's concept of \"preclusive victory,\" which he describes as \"anticipatory,\nprecautionary attention to possible futures,\" requiring an expansive and integrated approach to\nmodern diplomacy, defense, and development. A diplomatic strategy designed to produce\npreclusive victory will include conflict prevention, successful negotiation, deterrence, the\npreparation for conflict should all else fail, and efforts to establish order, ensure stability, and\npromote political and economic pluralism after conflict.\nDiplomats have always been participants in both the prevention and management of conflict and\nits aftermath. The conflict prevention side of diplomacy occupied much of my time at the State\nDepartment from 1993 to 1997 as the Department's Executive Secretary and U.S. Ambassador\nto Turkey. Postconflict diplomacy was a defining issue of the last third of my career at State as\nAssistant Secretary of State for European Affairs and as Under Secretary of State for Political\nAffairs from 2001 to 2005. I have tried to draw upon my experiences and observations to\ndiscuss here the scope and complexity of modern diplomacy, the methods and goals needed to\nprevent conflict, diplomacy's role when conflict is or seems to be unavoidable, and the\ncontribution diplomacy can make to restoring stability following conflict.\nDiplomacy and Conflict Prevention\nThanks to the efforts of scholars and practitioners, we can now make better use of the methods\nand theory of conflict prevention. The United States Institute of Peace and the Woodrow\nWilson International Center for Scholars are two among many institutions that have taken a\nleadership role in these efforts. Michael Lund, a practitionerscholar, notes that the present\nuncoordinated and patchy nature of preventive diplomacy reflects the absence of any accepted\ninternational conflict prevention regime or system of governance\u2014that is, of agreed upon\narrangements through which geographic jurisdictions are allocated, functional responsibilities\nare assigned, norms and procedures are formulated, and actors are held accountable for their\nresponsibilities.' He asks the crucial question to all those who seek to \"coordinate and\nrationalize\" a system of preventive diplomacy: where should responsibility for the tasks of\npreventive action be located\u2014early warning, the decision to act, the formulation of a response,\nor the provision of bureaucratic and political support? Should it be horizontal, across different\norganizations or actors, or should it be vertical, up or down their chains of command?6\nAn example of conflict prevention that meets Lund's tests was the effort undertaken by the\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), in close collaboration with the European Union\n(EU) and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and supported by the\nUnited States, to avoid civil war in Macedonia in 2001. It is difficult now to recall that, until\nSeptember 11, 2001, the possibility of civil war in Macedonia was a leading international\nheadline. This successful campaign of conflict prevention was defined by the remarkable\npersonal and institutional cooperation between the NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson\nand the EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (and a former\nNATO Secretary General) Javier Solana. I spoke often during this period to Lord Robertson,\nSolana, and Ambassador James Pardew, whom President George W. Bush and Secretary Colin\nPowell appointed as the U.S. representative to the effort and who, along with Francois Leotard,\nthe EU Special Envoy, played a crucial role in negotiating and implementing the Ohrid\nFramework Agreement.\nAs a direct participant, senior NATO official Mark Laity stated that there are insights about\nmodern diplomacy and conflict prevention to be drawn from this effort, including the need for\npersonal and institutional teamwork, the importance of early engagement in trying to head off\nviolence, the need to choose the right people for tasks of this kind (including 21st-century\ndiplomats who can act \"unconventionally\"), and the necessity of being able to apply appropriate\nforce quickly.'\nDiplomacy When Conflict Is or Seems to Be Unavoidable\nWhen diplomacy fails to prevent conflict, the role of the diplomat changes. The new\nrequirement may be to justify the use of force when all efforts to avoid conflict fail or to seek to\naddress the underlying source of conflict when force is or seems to be inevitable and\nimperative.\nThe February 1999 diplomatic negotiations in Rambouillet, France, were designed to show the\nworld that NATO and the Contact Group were willing to make one last effort to avoid using\nmilitary force to stop Slobodan Milosevic's attacks in Kosovo. I was in Rambouillet as Assistant\nSecretary of State for European Affairs to support Secretary Madeleine Albright. After the first\nday or so of the meeting, there was so much chaos that I urged Secretary Albright to depart\nRambouillet and leave the \"negotiating\" to those of us more junior. My strategy was that by not\nbeing present, the Secretary of State\u2014 and the administration\u2014could keep a distance from an\noutcome that might be unacceptable to the United States. The Secretary had a different vision.\nAlbright hoped Rambouillet would end the brutality against the Kosovars, but she was also\nprepared for the meeting to fail, and thereby all options for avoiding military conflict would be\nexhausted. Her idea was that we had to be seen to be doing everything we could diplomatically,\nincluding her continued presence, so that if Rambouillet was a failure, there could be no further\nexcuses against taking military action.\nSecretary of State James Baker had pursued a similar strategy before the first Gulf War in 1991.\nBaker relates in his memoirs, The Politics of Diplomacy, that President George H.W. Bush had\nconcluded the United States should offer a meeting in Washington for Iraqi Foreign Minister\nTariq Aziz followed by a Baker trip to Baghdad to show America's commitment to avoiding\nwar if possible. Baker writes that he thought this proposal had three merits: it would give the\nadministration one last diplomatic opening to avoid war; it would shore up domestic support for\nconflict; and it would show that, as the deadline for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait neared, the\nadministration was doing something other than just preparing for war. The President's offer\nturned into the famous meeting between Baker and Aziz on January 9, 1991. As Baker recounts,\n\"I was under no illusions. I assumed the talks would be unsuccessful and that within a matter of\ndays, we would be at war.\"8\nIn 2001-2003, the State Department leadership generally saw Iraq as a diversion from\nAfghanistan and not central to the war on terror. Saddam Hussein was a dictator and a\nmenace\u2014 but \"in a box,\" posing no immediate, direct threat to the United States; focus should\nbe kept on defeating al Qaeda in Afghanistan and supporting the new Afghan government.9 Iraq\nhad been a source of tension and disagreement inside the State Department since the beginning\nof the administration, and there were some who sought to move the policy from support for\n\"smart\" United Nations (UN) sanctions toward an aggressive posture against Saddam.\nSecretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote in Years of Upheaval about the second term of the\nNixon administration that State Department culture emphasizes negotiability, which is a\nconsciousness of what the other side will accept.' Kissinger did not consider this trait a\nparticular positive at the time, and the department's culture of negotiability did not serve as a\ngood guide to institutional behavior for most of the senior State officials who participated in the\ninteragency debate leading to the invasion of Iraq. If that was so during the period surrounding\n1970s d\u00e9tente with Russia, diplomatic efforts with the Shah of Iran, and the crisis in the Middle\nEast and the resulting 1973 war, this culture of negotiability no longer served as a good guide to\ninstitutional behavior for most of the senior State officials who participated in the interagency\ndebate leading to the invasion of Iraq. We took part in planning for the conflict and its aftermath\nassuming\u2014or hoping\u2014that events either at home or abroad would turn preparations for conflict\ninto successful coercive diplomacy rather than the military action that was ordered in the spring\nof 2003.\nThe State Department's Director of Policy Planning, Richard Haass, observed that while he was\n\"60:40 against going to war. . . no organization could function if people left every time they\nlost out on a 60:40 decision.\"' Haass was operating under the belief that Iraq had weapons of\nmass destruction; if he had known they did not, he says he would have been 90:10 against the\nwar.\nAnd no senior Department of State officer resigned in protest. The department sought instead to\ntry to recreate the successful Gulf War coalition of President George H.W. Bush and argued that\nthe United States and its allies might compel Saddam to submit through a deployment of force\nin the region in early 2003. If this failed, there should be a sustained diplomatic effort to create\na broad coalition to move militarily later in 2003. This possibility of a broad international\ncoalition lost all relevance on January 20, 2003, when the French government announced that it\nwould never support a second UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force in\nIraq.\nDiplomacy in Preparation for Conflict\nOnce conflict is inevitable or is initiated, one job of diplomats is to support military\ncommanders in getting what they need to make conflict as short as possible, with the fewest\ncasualties for Americans, allies, and civilians. This was the objective that the United States\npursued in Turkey before the first Gulf War, which resulted in President Turgut Ozal's support\nof American efforts. The diplomatic effort to prepare for conflict in Kosovo also involved the\nwhole of the U.S. Government and the governments of the NATO Allies. To pursue a\nsuccessful bombing campaign, diplomats in many NATO countries arranged for overflight and\nsupport for Allied forces. A similar effort by U.S. diplomats took place before the invasion of\nAfghanistan in 2001. American and allied diplomats worked closely with nations surrounding\nAfghanistan, including forging contacts with Central Asian states on security issues for the first\ntime in order to achieve transit, overflight, and bed-down rights for American and coalition\nforces before the October 7, 2001, beginning of action in Afghanistan.\nBefore the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, and especially after January 20, 2003, a similar\neffort began in earnest. Diplomats supported U.S. Central Command commander General\nTommy Franks in order to make the war as short and successful as possible and to limit\nAmerican, allied, and Iraqi civilian casualties. American diplomats worked with military\ncommanders to seek access to facilities for U.S. forces and to participate in the public\ndiplomacy effort to gain as much support as possible for the armed liberation of Iraq. American\ndiplomats and Pentagon officials again paid particular attention to Turkey in an effort to\nconvince the Turks to allow the 4th Infantry Division to transit that country to create a northern\nfront in the battle against Saddam's forces. Although the State Department worried about the\nsize of the Department of Defense (DOD) request to Ankara, it worked closely with both\ncivilian and military authorities at the Pentagon to try to meet the need that had been identified\nby the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Joint DOD\u2014State diplomacy, however, could not\novercome a negative vote in the Turkish parliament, which reflected strong public opposition to\nthe war.\nThe way the debate about using force is carried out inside the government influences attitudes\nand actions during and after conflict as well as future decisions on whether or not to use force.\nMilitary force may restore security, but it cannot resolve political or cultural sources of conflict.\nAs Rupert Smith writes, \"We are engaging in conflict for objectives that do not lead to a\nresolution of the matter directly by force of arms, since at all but the most basic tactical level\nour objectives tend to concern the intentions of the people and their leaders rather than their\nterritory or forces.\"' Smith argues that the civil-military structure designed to make political-\nmilitary decisions is \"deeply problematic\" and distorts decisionmaking in many ways.13 In his\nbook, Smith imagines a debate between British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and\nMinistry of Defense (MOD) officials about how to address the genocide taking place over a\nnumber of weeks in Rwanda during the summer of 1994.\nFCO: What can we do in the face of events in Rwanda?\nMOD: What do you want us to do?\nFCO: We ought to act. Something must be done. We can't have people being massacred. As a\npermanent member of the UN Security Council we cannot be seen to be doing nothing.\nMOD: So you want us to use military force?\nFCO: Yes.\nMOD: To do what? To stop the killing?\nFCO: Yes. Exactly.\nMOD: Who do you want us to fight? We are not clear who is doing the killing: is it tribe on\ntribe, or is it a force found _from a tribe? And Rwanda is a big country. Where do we start?\nKigali, presumably, it's the capital and we would want an airhead.\nFCO: Well, there must be an international force, of course.\nMOD: And what would be the British aim in joining the force?\nFCO: To play our part as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.\nMOD: Is Britain to lead the force?\nFCO: No, it should be led by the UN\u2014a proper UN mission.\nMOD: That will take some time to assemble, so it will probably be too late to stop the killing.\nFCO: Then the mission should be aimed at bringing postconflict order.\nMOD: OK But we need to be clear how many British troops are currently available. Given our\ndeployments in Ireland, Bosnia and a few other places, not many.\nFCO: What do you suggest?\nMOD: What are our government's priorities? Is contributing to this force a higher priority than\nthese other tasks we are already undertaking?\nFCO: Probably not.\nMOD: In that case, these UN forces always lack expeditionary logistic support. And if we want\nto speed up the deployment of this force, offering a logistic unit would probably be the most\nvaluable contribution.\nFCO: Will that put our soldiers at risk?\nMOD: Hardly any.\"\nMany American diplomats will recognize this imaginary conversation, having participated in\nsomething like it dozens of times since the fall of the Berlin Wall. In the American debate, the\nissue also quickly focuses on who pays the bills. It is worth stating, at least in the American\ncase, that officials at the Pentagon and DOD often were legitimately frustrated by the State\nDepartment's inclination to promote military missions for the Pentagon and the Armed Forces\nin an increasing number of situations that were important, but not vital, to U.S. national\ninterests. While this readiness to volunteer U.S. military forces to solve problems around the\nworld was a direct result of the lack of civilian capacity to do the jobs required, it leads to\nunderstandable consternation among those in uniform.\nDiplomacy and Restoring Stability Following Conflict\nThere are many issues\u2014defeating extremism, promoting pluralism, bringing the benefits of\nglobalization to those who have not yet benefited, living sustainably on the planet,\nnonproliferation\u2014 that will be part of any definition of successful 21st-century diplomacy. But\ngetting postconflict diplomacy right\u2014creating the conditions for a preclusive victory\u2014may be\nthe most crucial of all. This is not an easy assignment. The concept of success can be redefined\nafter the fact, further complicating the assessment. Successful democratic governance and\neconomic development cannot be delivered on a certain date, and therefore the need for time\nand patience is a necessity on the ground. However, patience is limited in home countries, and\n\"fatigue\" often sets in. Thus, the potential for failure is high. Industrial war produced winners\nand losers; today's lines are not so clearly drawn, and the timeline may be longer.\nRupert Smith again brings clarity to this assessment:\nWe intervene in or even decide to escalate to, a conflict in order to establish a condition in\nwhich the political objective can be achieved by other means and in other ways. We seek to\ncreate a conceptual space for diplomacy, economic incentives, political pressure and other\nmeasures to create a desired political outcome of stability, and if possible democracy. . . . if a\ndecisive strategic victory was the hallmark of interstate industrial war, establishing a condition\nmay be deemed a hallmark of the new paradigm of war amongst the people.15\nSmith's point can be pressed even further by recognizing the additional distinction between a\nmilitary operation carried out following Smith's rules and the ambiguity inherent in trying to\ncreate the conditions Smith identifies as objectives. Christopher Schnaubelt has noted that a\ntypical military operation will have unambiguous geographic boundaries (areas of\nresponsibility) and will assign specific units to be responsible for every inch of ground or cubic\nfoot of airspace. There is an obvious chain of responsibilities and expected actions between\neach individual Soldier or Marine on the ground and the commanding general. Nothing\ncomparable exists for economic development in governance tasks, which tend to be assigned by\nfunction rather than local geography or rigid hierarchy of authority.16\nPostconflict diplomacy was among the defining diplomatic issues of the last third of my career\nat the State Department.\nIn the aftermath of the first Gulf War in 1991, almost 500,000 Kurds fled to the mountains\nbetween Iraq and Turkey. Stranded in harsh conditions, they began to starve by the thousands\neach day. I was then the Deputy Chief of Mission in Turkey. Inspired by the leadership of\nAmbassador Morton Abramowitz, American diplomats, followed by American military forces\nand then an international coalition of governments and nongovernmental organizations, initiated\nOperation Provide Comfort (which became Operation Northern Watch). This was not just a\n\"whole-of-government\" but a \"whole-of-theinternational- community\" campaign to provide\nhumanitarian assistance and then return the Kurds to their homes in Northern Iraq. Once home,\nthey needed to be protected, and for 11 years, the United Sates and some of its allies, including\nTurkey, worked on the ground there to recreate a functioning society and then protected this\narea from Saddam by enforcing a no-fly zone.\nThese years were also punctuated by activity in the Balkans. As Richard Holbrooke recounts,\nsome of the pre-Dayton negotiations with Bosnian leader Alija Izetbegovi took place in my\nresidence while I was Ambassador to Turkey:7 As one of Holbrooke's successors as Assistant\nSecretary for European Affairs, I watched the effort made by Ambassadors Robert Gelbard and\nJames Dobbins to implement the Dayton Accords by applying whole-of-government efforts in\npostconflict post- Yugoslavia. I picked up the diplomatic thread again as Under Secretary of\nState for Political Affairs promoting reconciliation, development, political progress, and\nnationbuilding in Kosovo.\nOther postconflict diplomacy efforts in Haiti, East Timor, and Liberia called upon the resources\nof the United States and other governments to try to create the conceptual space for\ndevelopment and sustained peace. The U.S. effort in Colombia, too, highlighted the need to\nfocus on an integrated and cross-sectoral approach, which included disarmament,\ndemobilization, and reintegration of former combatants and promoted justice in postconflict\nsociety. But the main events in modern diplomacy's postconflict paradigm are Afghanistan and\nIraq.\nThe key to understanding U.S. diplomacy in postconflict Afghanistan and Iraq is to recall the\nprofound disagreement inside the U.S. Government, especially between DOD and State, about\nwhether the United States should engage in \"nationbuilding,\" a policy President Bush had\ncampaigned against in 2000. State Department professionals were generally proud of the effort\nthe United States had made in nationbuilding and in peacekeeping, supporting the deployment\nof U.S. military forces to participate, for example, in the Multinational Force and Observers in\nthe Sinai and in peacekeeping and nationbuilding activities in East Timor, Haiti, and the\nBalkans. Most believed that nationbuilding, properly funded and executed, was an effective\nlong-term tool of integrated modern diplomacy for the United States.\nThe effort to create a new Afghan government after the overthrow of the Taliban was a piece of\nclassical diplomacy carried out in the 21st-century context.'8 Secretary Powell directed\nAmbassador Dobbins to support the regional negotiation hosted by the Germans in Bonn in\n2001 to create a new Afghan government. To succeed, Dobbins worked with all the key players,\nincluding representatives from Iran, to support a major role for the United Nations and put\nHamid Karzai in position to lead a new Afghanistan.' But, as Dobbins has written, the \"Bush\nAdministration, having overthrown the Taliban and installed a new government in Kabul,\ndetermined that American troops would do no peacekeeping and that peacekeepers from other\ncountries would not be allowed to venture beyond the Kabul city limits. Public security\nthroughout the rest of the country would be left entirely to Afghans, despite the fact that\nAfghanistan had no army and no police force.\"2\u00b0\nThe struggle over nationbuilding also hampered American attempts to get sufficient amounts of\nU.S. or international assistance to Afghanistan. Washington accepted the diffusion of\nresponsibility there, with the British taking charge of counternarcotics, the Italians reforming\nthe justice sector, and the Germans training police. This satisfied the need for burden-sharing\nbut did not lead to success. In addition, postconflict resources focused by the United States on\nAfghanistan were small compared to other recent postconflict situations, even including\nKosovo.' American diplomats who followed Dobbins to the Embassy in Kabul over the years\nfaced the legacy of this lack of attention and underinvestment.22\nThe State Department participated at many levels in the National Security Council\u2014led planning\nfor postconflict Iraq. Much of the planning was detailed, but focused on lessons learned from\nthe first Gulf War. The department's Future of Iraq Project, while important, would not have\nsolved Iraq's postwar problems. State did not have the capacity to take responsibility for the\nimmediate postconflict administration of Iraq, and its leadership agreed to the Executive order\ncreating a postconflict Iraq structure that reported to the Secretary of Defense.\nThere is no need here to recount the lost lives and lost opportunities so well chronicled by\nothers in the immediate postconflict period in Iraq, although Dobbins's argument that, looking\nback, the Coalition Provisional Authority accomplished a great deal under trying circumstances\nis worth noting.23 On July 1, 2004, the State Department did officially open (on time and on\nbudget) an Embassy in Baghdad, which allowed an expansion of diplomacy and led to more\ncomprehensive senior civilian-military cooperation.\nThere is another important lesson to draw from recent postconflict efforts: the need to have\nadequate civilian capacity to respond, including a role for a revitalized U.S. Agency for\nInternational Development (USAID). As this journal chronicled in an article' by Ambassador\nJohn Herbst, the Secretary of State's Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS),\nhis office was mandated to develop a whole-ofgovernment civilian response to stability\noperations and to ensure civilian-military coordination.\nThe Civilian Response Corps (CRC) is in an early stage, and ultimately will be made up of a\nreserve component, in addition to the existing active and standby components. The personnel\nare anticipated to represent the full range of sector experts: engineers, lawyers, judges,\ncorrections officials, diplomats, development experts, public administrators, public health\nofficials, city planners, border control officials, economists, and others. Currently, the active\nand standby components that are being stepped up are drawn from State, USAID, and a core\ngroup of domestic U.S. Agencies.\nOnce congressionally funded, the reserves would be drawn from state and local governments\nand the private sector. Between January 2008 and May 2009, 56 CRC members deployed to 11\ncountries, including Afghanistan for planning purposes, and there are realistic plans to have 250\nactive members and 1,000 standby members ready to deploy by the end of 2010. There are now\nat least 14 other countries with whom the United States allies that have a civilian peacebuilding\ncapacity\u2014some including stability or civilian police, and employing wholeof- government or\n\"comprehensive\" approaches similar to that created by Washington. Several, in fact, have\nhigher budgets proportionate to their gross national products than America's.25\nOne way for State to further support the S/CRS effort would be to consider creating a new\npersonnel specialty: the \"expeditionary diplomat.\" Washington's diplomatic personnel have, of\ncourse, always been in one sense expeditionary; the majority of the Foreign Service is deployed\nabroad the majority of the time. But the post-9/11 diplomatic experience, and especially the\neffort in Iraq and Afghanistan, means that State needs to be more explicit about the\nexpeditionary nature of some of its future diplomatic work and should prepare a small but\nsignificant number of people to serve successfully in the hardest places at a moment's notice.\nExperience with the Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Iraq and Afghanistan, the lessons\nlearned with S/CRS, and the example of diplomats who have pursued careers in the toughest\nposts should lead State leadership to conclude that this is a step worth taking. The first\nrequirement would be advanced training, some of it provided by DOD and some by the Central\nIntelligence Agency, for those entering diplomats who believe they want to pursue this special\ncareer path. These entering officers would make an explicit choice and understand that an\ninvestment in their extra training would require their service in hard places, just as we now ask\ndiplomats who take the hardest languages\u2014 Chinese or Arabic, for example\u2014to serve more\nthan one tour using their skills. Since these expeditionary diplomats will not need to meet the\nsame age and physical requirements as special operations in the military, the State Department\ncould allow people to opt in and out of this \"special force\" during their careers as long as they\nhave the proper training. This would allow flexibility across the institution and encourage those\nwho desire or whose family circumstances might change over time to participate as well. The\ndepartment would also need to make sure those taking this career path are recognized for a\ncareer beyond the norm for Foreign Service and are promoted and rewarded.\nThe creation of S/CRS is a symbol of the comprehensive, simultaneous diplomacy needed for\nthe future, and this expeditionary diplomat could form the backbone of the State and USAID\ncommitment to the civilian response capacity. There are still key questions to be answered\nabout civilian capacity. In the face of a real world situation, will DOD really support a State\nDepartment\u2014led operation? Will Congress adequately fund S/CRS, including a reasonable\ncontingency fund? How will S/CRS and a resurgent USAID work together? Where will the\nlines be drawn between immediate postconflict needs and nationbuilding? There seems to be no\nquestion that the path is the right one, consistent with the administration's focus on diplomacy,\ndevelopment, and defense. Success will come with clear direction and active implementation.\nIf we combine the observations made by several authors,' we arrive at this question: What\nnational policies, supported by adequate human and financial resources, will create the\nconditions during and after war to bring about a preclusive victory? Nation building, post-\nconflict reconstruction and stability operations, and counterinsurgency strategy (call it what we\nwill) will be part of modern diplomacy for years to come. Accomplishing this task does not\nhave to be an exclusively American responsibility, and, indeed, one of the goals of modern\nAmerican diplomats will be to make these efforts more international. But for the foreseeable\nfuture, the United States will need to learn the lessons of its role in nation building from\nGermany to Iraq.\" These lessons include support for new institutions that bring all of the\nelements of power and influence together in the same theater, at the same time, and in close\ncoordination so the United States and its allies and friends have a chance to succeed.28 As Philip\nBobbitt has written, \"The problem is the picture of warfare to which we cling. This picture\nunfolds in this way: peace making by diplomats; war making by the Armed Forces; peace\nbuilding by [US]AID and reconstruction personnel. The reality of 21st century warfare,\nhowever, is that all of these tasks must be performed simultaneously.\"'\nWhile the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century can be observed and analyzed\nindividually, none of them can be solved without reference to the others. Diplomacy is not the\nanswer to every question, but it has utility both before and after conflict. As General Smith\nwrites at the end of his volume:\nFor the general purpose of all interventions is clear: we seek to establish in the minds of the\npeople and their leaders that the ever present option of conflict is not the preferable course of\naction when in confrontation over some matter or another. This applies as much to the state\npossessing nuclear weapons or seeking to obtain them, rogue or otherwise, as it does to the *\nterrorist or the machete-wielding rebel; each is posing an armed threat to people to establish a\ncondition in which to achieve its political goal. To do this, military force is a valid option, a\nlever of intervention and influence, as much as economic, political and diplomatic levers, but to\nbe effective it must be applied as apart of a greater scheme focusing all measures on the one\ngoal.3\u00b0\nThe connection to the utility of a modern diplomacy is clear. Twenty-first-century diplomacy,\nworking to prevent conflict, trying to get ready for it if it is inevitable, or dealing with the\nconsequences, can be an effective tool of national security if it is adequately funded, carried out\nby well-trained, dedicated people, focused on clear goals set by national leaders, and backed by\neffective military force. This is the diplomacy of the future.\nThe author expresses appreciation to The Cohen Group for allowing him time to consider\nthese issues and to the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the\nHarvard John F. Kennedy School Project on Diplomacy for supporting the effort.

But senior\ndiplomats predicted there would be intense private discussion on the fringes of the summit over the question: who will get\nthe plum job of first sitting president of the European council, the pre-eminent EU forum that brings leaders together for\nsummits at least four times a year.\nDavid Miliband, the foreign secretary, said today that Blair would give Europe a \"strong voice\" on the global stage, but his\ncomments were seized on by his Conservative shadow, William Hague, who said the debate over the presidency proved\nthat the UK should have held a referendum on the Lisbon treaty.\nOfficially, the job does not exist until Klaus finalises Czech ratification of the treaty, expected within weeks. While Blair\npersonally has kept quiet about his ambitions, the British government is campaigning increasingly assertively on the\nformer prime minister's behalf.\n\"We will be making the case for a strong, internationally known figure who can open doors in [foreign] capitals,\" said an\nofficial. \"There is only one candidate.\"\nThat was not a reference to Jean-Claude Juncker, the veteran Luxembourg prime minister and European fixer, who is the\nonly contender so far to have openly declared his candidacy. He emerged this week as the anti-Blair.\nJuncker looks certain to fail in his bid for the top job. But he may well succeed in destroying Blair's chances, being viewed\nas a stalking horse who will vanish to make way for a third unknown contender.\nWhile the Blair debate rages on the sidelines of the summit, the big priority for the Swedish government chairing the\nmeeting is to try to break a deadlock on EU funding of climate change programmes in the developing world ahead of the\nCopenhagen conference in December.\nBerlin and Warsaw are the keys to a deal, but the prospects for a breakthrough look dim. Fredrik Reinfeldt, the Swedish\nprime minister, warned that Europe's credibility on global warming was at stake.\nIn recent weeks European governments have locked horns over the financing package and have been unable to reach\nagreement. The aim is to come up with pledges of an EU fund of up to \u20ac15bn (\u00a313.4bn) a year by 2020 for transfers to the\ndeveloping countries to combat global warming. The overall package is central to a Copenhagen deal.\nBut with the other big players, especially the US, which is reluctant to commit to a figure, Germany believes Europe\nshould not show its hand until the Copenhagen negotiations. The European commission and others such as the UK and\nthe Scandinavians believe agreeing on a figure in advance would strengthen Europe's global leadership role on climate\nchange and send a strong signal to other potential signatories.\nThe Poles and other eastern Europeans are unhappy at being asked to stump up for developing countries such as Brazil,\nwhich is wealthier than the poorer EU members. The Poles are refusing to agree a package and figures for Copenhagen\nunless it is first decided how the bill will be split among the EU's 27 governments. In the midst of a financial crisis, the\neastern Europeans say they cannot afford the climate change fund.\nAngela Merkel, sworn in yesterday for a second term as German chancellor, will be pivotal to any climate change\nfinancing deal and her answer to the Blair question may also be decisive. So far, she has been hedging her bets.\nWhile Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, is known to support Blair with reservations, there are no German candidates\nfor the two big new jobs being created under Lisbon \u2014 the European president and a European foreign minister or high\nrepresentative for foreign and security policy.\nIn Paris last night the French and German leaders discussed the posts, although there was little information on whether\nthey reached a pact. Sarkozy said the two leaders agreed on \"almost everything\".\nAustria, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg \u2014 all said to nurse ambitions to secure the presidential post\nthemselves \u2014 have come out publicly against Blair on the grounds that he would neglect the interests of smaller EU\nmember states \u2014 19 out of the total 27.\nAdding his voice to the argument, Demitris Christofias, the president of Cyprus, said a council president \"from a small\ncountry would be more objective and more consensual. The European Union is a family of compromises.\"\nThe Dutch centre-right prime minister and possible contender, Jan-Peter Balkenende, has come under pressure this week\nto renounce European presidential ambitions since his move to Brussels could trigger early elections and the fall of his\ngovernment.\nChristofias emphasised that tonight the priority would be to get the Klaus blocking of the Lisbon treaty lifted rather than\nfocusing on who gets what under Lisbon.\nSenior diplomats agreed it was too early to discuss names.

In exchange, she said, African leaders must deliver democracy and good government.\nMrs. Clinton vowed to stay on top of Africa, even after she gets back to Washington, closely monitoring the issues she\naddressed on her tour. She also pointed to Cape Verde, a set of palm-studded islands best known for their beaches and\nenormous tourist hotels, as an example of what good leadership can do.\n\"This is possible,\" she said. \"You create not just economic growth but a sense of human dignity and possibility.\"\nKenya. South Africa. Angola. Congo. Nigeria. Liberia. And finally Cape Verde. Mrs. Clinton saw with her own eyes some of\nAfrica's most promising countries - and some of its most troubled ones. In Kenya, she pushed for the government to\nprosecute perpetrators of the postelection violence last year. In South Africa, the big issue was Zimbabwe and how the\nSouth African government should do more to help ease the crisis there.\nIn Angola, the theme was good governing practices and oil, a strategic concern of the United States given the many\ninroads China has made there and elsewhere in Africa in its hunger for natural resources. In Congo, Mrs. Clinton was\npassionate about the need to end the nation's rape epidemic.\n\"The secretary's visit to the heart of the world's deadliest war zone in eastern Congo was a potential game-changer for\nthat conflict,\" said John Prendergast, a founder of the Washington-based Enough project. \"Her commitment to\naddressing root causes such as the conflict minerals that power our electronics industry was a refreshing contrast to the\nusual disaster sympathy tourism of visiting dignitaries.\"\n\"Now,\" he added, \"comes the hard part: making good on the promises and living up to the high expectations\nengendered by her visit.\"\nIn Nigeria, Mrs. Clinton pressed for electoral changes. In Liberia, she praised the country's president, Ellen Johnson\nSirleaf, the only woman in Africa to be elected head of state.\nThe Liberian visit had a special warmth, almost like a meeting of long-lost cousins. Liberia was founded in the 19th\ncentury by freed American slaves, and the country's flag, the people's names and even the police uniforms with plastic-\nbrimmed hats were all reminiscent of the American versions. Mrs. Clinton received possibly her most exuberant\nwelcome there, and a Liberian man with a long wooden horn followed her around most of the visit, blowing out loud\nfunny noises whenever she said something striking.\n\"I love that - the horn - I want to take that guy with me wherever I go,\" she said.\nIn Cape Verde, Mrs. Clinton seemed to have few bones to pick. For once, she said, she had a cheat sheet on a country\nthat included a list of far more positives than negatives. The country has fewer than 500,000 people and has escaped the\nturmoil that has engulfed so much of Africa. The all-inclusive, poolside buffet resorts here feel like something found in\nCanctIn or the Bahamas.\nMrs. Clinton called Cape Verde \"a model of democracy and economic progress in Africa.\"\nOn Friday, just as she had at every stop, she started her speech by saying, \"I bring you greetings from President Obama.\"\nShe called him a \"son of Africa\" and said that under the Obama administration, the United States was determined to\nhelp Africa reach its promise.\n###", "nbr_mention": 6, "sentiment": 3, "sentence": " clinton seemed satisfied that she had accomplished her mission: strengthening american relations with crucial\nallies on the continent, like nigeria and south africa, and sending a message of \"tough love,\" as she called it, to nations\nlike kenya and congo"}, "Spain": {"mention": ["spain", "spain", "spain", "spain", "spain", "spain", "spain", "spain", "spain", "spain", "spain", "spain"], "text": "A pouch with all of your call sheets and the schedule in en route to you.

We're sharing the FT op-ed page tomorrow. Here's\nmy piece....\nThanks again for Friday. Much favorable comment. Good luck at the UNGA.\nPresident Barack Obama's announcement of a new system.for protecting America's\nallies against Iranian missiles has ignited charges that he is scaling back the one he\ninherited from George W. Bush as a concession to the Russians.\nIn fact, the Obama plan is a big improvement on the Bush one, and it is designed to\ncounter an evolving Iranian threat, not to mollify Russian anxieties.\nMr Bush's decision to put 10 missile interceptors in Poland and an associated radar in\nthe Czech Republic was based on a concern that Iran was developing long-range rockets\nthat could hit the US. The Bush system would have been less effective against shorter-\nrange Iranian missiles, and it would have left much of Europe, notably including America's\nally Turkey, unprotected.\nOver the last several years, the Iranians have shifted their efforts from developing a few\nlong-range rockets to deploying large numbers of shorter-range ones that pose an\nimmediate danger to southeastern Europe and the Middle East, as well as to US forces\nstationed there. Unlike Mr Bush's, Mr Obama's plan will quickly field a missile-defence\ncapability to address an existing threat. It can be upgraded to deal with longer-range\nIranian missiles in the future.\nThe Central Europeans who have reacted to the decision with apprehension or alarm\nshould recognize that the replacement of a conceptually flawed plan with a more credible\none strengthens the bonds of transatlantic defence.\nThe view from Moscow has been clouded by outright paranoia. Military experts there\nsuspected that the US rockets in Poland, while advertised as defensive, could be used\noffensively, even pre-emptively, against Russia. Laying to rest that far-fetched scenario\nwas not the prime motivation for Mr Obama's decision, nor should it have been. However,\nby removing what has been a gratuitous irritant in bilateral relations, the president has\nimproved the prospects for US-Russian arms control negotiations now underway in\nGeneva.\nThose talks could produce by December a new treaty reducing numbers of strategic -\nthat is, intercontinental \u2014 weapons. If ratified by the US Senate (which will not be easy,\ngiven the ferocity of the partisan wars in Washington), the US and Russia will be on track\nfor further reductions in the future. Mr Obama and Russian President Dmitri Medvedev,\nwho are due to meet in New York this week, have jointly called for the eventual goal of\neliminating nuclear weapons.\nAs they and their successors take steps in that direction, they will have to grapple with a\nstark paradox of the nuclear age: mutual deterrence depends on each side being\nvulnerable to retaliation from the other. If either side has enough defences to trump the\nother side's offence, the mutuality of deterrence breaks down and one or both sides will be\non hair-trigger, making war more likely in a crisis.\nAmerican statesmen pounded this inescapable truth into the heads of their initially\nsceptical Soviet counterparts 40 years ago. The result was the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)\ntreaty signed by Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev in 1972. By limiting the defensive\ncapability of both superpowers, the ABM treaty was a necessary companion piece to a\nseries of treaties setting ceilings on offensive weaponry. Because nuclear weapons were\nexpected to with us forever, the ABM treaty was meant to last in perpetuity.\nWhile the Soviets were converted to the logic of restricting defence, Ronald Reagan\nwas not. The late US president championed the development of a space-based\ncomprehensive shield that would make offensive weapons \u2014 and therefore mutual\ndeterrence \u2014 \"impotent and obsolete.\"\nMany experts believed Reagan's vision, which they derisively nicknamed Star Wars, was\nan impossible dream. So did his successor, George H. W. Bush, who treated the program\nwith benign neglect while negotiating with the Russians in the Strategic Arms Reduction\nTalks (START) begun by Mr Reagan.\nThe second president Bush reversed his father's policy. He greatly weakened the\nSTART process, pulled the US out of the ABM treaty and sought to revive a national\nmissile defence (NMD) system. His decision to build the interceptor and radar sites in\nPoland and the Czech Republic was, as one of his aides told me at the time, in large\nmeasure about \"pouring concrete for what will eventually be a global NMD.\"\nKey officials of the Obama administration \u2014 including the president himself, who studied\narms control in college \u2014 understand the linkage between reduction of offences and\nregulation of defences. However, they have avoided raising that issue in the context of last\nweek's decision. That is partly because they want their plan to be judged on its own\nmerits, vis-\u00e0-vis the Iranian threat. But it is because they have more than enough fights\nwith the Republicans without further energizing the right wing by trying to reinstate the\nprinciples of the ABM treaty.\nYet sooner or later the US administration will have to grasp the nettle of regulating\nstrategic defences. Otherwise, continued reductions in strategic nuclear offences will be\neither impossible or, worse, dangerous.\nThe author is president of the Brookings Institution.", "nbr_mention": 30, "sentiment": -4, "sentence": "\nmr bush's decision to put 10 missile interceptors in poland and an associated radar in\nthe czech republic was based on a concern that iran was developing long-range rockets\nthat could hit the us"}, "Myanmar": {"mention": ["myanmar", "myanmar"], "text": "Dear Secretary Clinton,\nI hope that your elbow is healing quickly. I mentioned that we were doing some work on maritime developments in the\nregion from the Persian Gulf to the East China Sea and Sea of Japan. Below are key findings from the report, but the\nmain takeaway is that the political impact of Chinese military modernization may be greater than a narrow technical\nanalysis of China's capabilities would suggest, and for a range of reasons, technical and political, prospects for regional\ncooperation are limited, but pathways to conflict are numerous and increasing.\nAll best, Jackie\nKey findings from the workshop include:\n\u2022 Chinese naval modernization has proceeded at rates higher than\nforecast 10 years ago and has created the capability to complicate operation of US carrier battle groups within 1,000\nkilometers of the Chinese coastline.\n\u2022 The Indian Ocean may in the coming decades be the operating area of\nSSBNs from countries with limited experience in sustained SSBN patrols, including India, China, and possibly Pakistan.\n\u2022 Chinese maritime relations with countries along the littoral area\nhave continued to develop, with a new friendly relationship emerging with Sri Lanka, to complement the existing\nrelations with Myanmar and Pakistan. This may lead to a new form of \"blue-brown water\" naval operations, in which\nChinese naval forces operate far from Chinese bases, but close to the coasts of client states.\nThe workshop tended to the conclusion that the trends in the region were not such as to make maritime cooperation\neasy. These trends\ninclude:\nJapanese concern that Chinese dominance in the waters within 1,000\nmiles of Chinese territory has immediate consequences for Japan's maritime autonomy.\n\u2022 Indian suspicion of Chinese naval developments in Hainan Island,\nChinese development of port infrastructure in Pakistan and Myanmar, and the possibility of Chinese ballistic missile\nsubmarines operating close to India.\n\u2022 Indian interest in SSBNs, plus Chinese SSBN ports in Hainan and\neven, possibly, Pakistani SSBNs, all of which creates the possibility of multiple SSBN patrols in the Indian Ocean, along\nwith the potential for naval nuclear accidents at sea.\n\u2022 Asymmetries in levels of operational competence, and technology, in\nsubmarines and maritime aviation, which, for example, make functional multi-national naval cooperation harder for\nstates that are afraid of revealing technologies or weaknesses.\n\u2022 The major role of land-based maritime warfare strike complexes in\nthis region, which means that war at sea always carries with it the risk of escalation to strikes on ground targets in\nhomeland areas.\nThe report also offers two scenarios under which the United States may consider engaging militarily in the region.\nThe first scenario, which concerns a clash between Japan and China in waters claimed by both, compels us to consider:\n\u2022 The circumstances under which the Chinese may seek to demonstrate\nthat their new maritime capabilities must be taken seriously and respected, and\n\u2022 What the United States would lose if it did not support the\nJapanese, and then faced a world in which Japan became either a subordinate power to China or a nuclear armed state,\ncapable of pursuing its national interest independent of the United States.\nThe second scenario concerns an American naval blockade of an Iran that has tested a nuclear weapon, potentially\ngiving rise to an interaction between the United States and China far from the operating bases of each but close to\nterritory of a client of China, a \"blue-brown water\" clash. In this scenario, China is using its navy to show presence, and\nto force the United States to ask itself whether it wants to go to war with China over a political conflict that is less than\nblack and white. Thinking about the options that would be left to the United States under these circumstances\nunderscores how Chinese naval forces may have more political impact by 2025 than a narrow assessment of their\nmilitary capabilities would suggest.\nOn Fri, May 22, 2009 at 7:45 AM, <newmyer wrote:\n> Secretary Clinton, The Australian is the newspaper in which I read\n> your remarks on Asia-Pacific.

Stanley McChrystal. It's a Thursday night in mid-April,\nand the commander of all U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan is sitting in a four-star suite at the HOtel Westminster in\nParis. He's in France to sell his new war strategy to our NATO allies \u2014 to keep up the fiction, in essence, that we actually\nhave allies. Since McChrystal took over a year ago, the Afghan war has become the exclusive property of the United\nStates. Opposition to the war has already toppled the Dutch government, forced the resignation of Germany's president\nand sparked both Canada and the Netherlands to announce the withdrawal of their 4,500 troops. McChrystal is in Paris to\nkeep the French, who have lost more than 40 soldiers in Afghanistan, from going all wobbly on him.\n\"The dinner comes with the position, sir,\" says his chief of staff, Col. Charlie Flynn.\nMcChrystal turns sharply in his chair.\n\"Hey, Charlie,\" he asks, \"does this come with the position?\"\nMcChrystal gives him the middle finger.\nThe general stands and looks around the suite that his traveling staff of 10 has converted into a full-scale operations\ncenter. The tables are crowded with silver Panasonic Toughbooks, and blue cables crisscross the hotel's thick carpet,\nhooked up to satellite dishes to provide encrypted phone and e-mail communications. Dressed in off-the-rack civilian\ncasual \u2014 blue tie, button-down shirt, dress slacks \u2014 McChrystal is way out of his comfort zone. Paris, as one of his\nadvisers says, is the \"most anti-McChrystal city you can imagine.\" The general hates fancy restaurants, rejecting any\nplace with candles on the tables as too \"Gucci.\" He prefers Bud Light Lime (his favorite beer) to Bordeaux, Talladega\nNights (his favorite movie) to Jean-Luc Godard. Besides, the public eye has never been a place where McChrystal felt\ncomfortable: Before President Obama put him in charge of the war in Afghanistan, he spent five years running the\nPentagon's most secretive black ops.\n\"What's the update on the Kandahar bombing?\" McChrystal asks Flynn. The city has been rocked by two massive car\nbombs in the past day alone, calling into question the general's assurances that he can wrest it from the Taliban.\n\"We have two KIAs, but that hasn't been confirmed,\" Flynn says.\nMcChrystal takes a final look around the suite. At 55, he is gaunt and lean, not unlike an older version of Christian Bale in\nRescue Dawn. His slate-blue eyes have the unsettling ability to drill down when they lock on you. If you've fucked up or\ndisappointed him, they can destroy your soul without the need for him to raise his voice.\n\"I'd rather have my ass kicked by a roomful of people than go out to this dinner,\" McChrystal says.\nHe pauses a beat.\n\"Unfortunately,\" he adds, \"no one in this room could do it.\"\nWith that, he's out the door.\n\"Who's he going to dinner with?\" I ask one of his aides.\n\"Some French minister,\" the aide tells me. \"It's fucking gay.\"\nThe next morning, McChrystal and his team gather to prepare for a speech he is giving at the Ecole Militaire, a French\nmilitary academy. The general prides himself on being sharper and ballsier than anyone else, but his brashness comes\nwith a price: Although McChrystal has been in charge of the war for only a year, in that short time he has managed to piss\noff almost everyone with a stake in the conflict. Last fall, during the question-and-answer session following a speech he\ngave in London, McChrystal dismissed the counterterrorism strategy being advocated by Vice President Joe Biden as\n\"shortsighted,\" saying it would lead to a state of \"Chaos-istan.\" The remarks earned him a smackdown from the president\nhimself, who summoned the general to a terse private meeting aboard Air Force One. The message to McChrystal\nseemed clear: Shut the fuck up, and keep a lower profile\nNow, flipping through printout cards of his speech in Paris, McChrystal wonders aloud what Biden question he might get\ntoday, and how he should respond. \"I never know what's going to pop out until I'm up there, that's the problem,\" he says.\nThen, unable to help themselves, he and his staff imagine the general dismissing the vice president with a good one-\nliner.\n\"Are you asking about Vice President Biden?\" McChrystal says with a laugh. \"Who's that?\"\n\"Biden?\" suggests a top adviser. \"Did you say: Bite Me?\"\nWhen Barack Obama entered the Oval Office, he immediately set out to deliver on his most important campaign\npromise on foreign policy: to refocus the war in Afghanistan on what led us to invade in the first place. \"I want the\nAmerican people to understand,\" he announced in March 2009. \"We have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle\nand defeat Al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan.\" He ordered another 21,000 troops to Kabul, the largest increase since\nthe war began in 2001. Taking the advice of both the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he also fired Gen. David\nMcKiernan \u2014 then the U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan \u2014 and replaced him with a man he didn't know and had\nmet only briefly: Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It was the first time a top general had been relieved from duty during wartime in\nmore than 50 years, since Harry Truman fired Gen. Douglas MacArthur at the height of the Korean War.\nEven though he had voted for Obama, McChrystal and his new commander in chief failed from the outset to connect. The\ngeneral first encountered Obama a week after he took office, when the president met with a dozen senior military officials\nin a room at the Pentagon known as the Tank. According to sources familiar with the meeting, McChrystal thought Obama\nlooked \"uncomfortable and intimidated\" by the roomful of military brass. Their first one-on-one meeting took place in the\nOval Office four months later, after McChrystal got the Afghanistan job, and it didn't go much better. \"It was a 10-minute\nphoto op,\" says an adviser to McChrystal. \"Obama clearly didn't know anything about him, who he was. Here's the guy\nwho's going to run his fucking war, but he didn't seem very engaged. The Boss was pretty disappointed.\"\nFrom the start, McChrystal was determined to place his personal stamp on Afghanistan, to use it as a laboratory for a\ncontroversial military strategy known as counterinsurgency. COIN, as the theory is known, is the new gospel of the\nPentagon brass, a doctrine that attempts to square the military's preference for high-tech violence with the demands of\nfighting protracted wars in failed states. COIN calls for sending huge numbers of ground troops to not only destroy the\nenemy, but to live among the civilian population and slowly rebuild, or build from scratch, another nation's government \u2014 a\nprocess that even its staunchest advocates admit requires years, if not decades, to achieve. The theory essentially\nrebrands the military, expanding its authority (and its funding) to encompass the diplomatic and political sides of warfare:\nThink the Green Berets as an armed Peace Corps. In 2006, after Gen. David Petraeus beta-tested the theory during his\n\"surge\" in Iraq, it quickly gained a hardcore following of think-tankers, journalists, military officers and civilian officials.\nNicknamed \"COINdinistas\" for their cultish zeal, this influential cadre believed the doctrine would be the perfect solution\nfor Afghanistan. All they needed was a general with enough charisma and political savvy to implement it.\nAs McChrystal leaned on Obama to ramp up the war, he did it with the same fearlessness he used to track down terrorists\nin Iraq: Figure out how your enemy operates, be faster and more ruthless than everybody else, then take the fuckers out.\nAfter arriving in Afghanistan last June, the general conducted his own policy review, ordered up by Defense Secretary\nRobert Gates. The now-infamous report was leaked to the press, and its conclusion was dire: If we didn't send another\n40,000 troops \u2014 swelling the number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan by nearly half \u2014 we were in danger of \"mission failure.\"\nThe White House was furious. McChrystal, they felt, was trying to bully Obama, opening him up to charges of being weak\non national security unless he did what the general wanted. It was Obama versus the Pentagon, and the Pentagon was\ndetermined to kick the president's ass.\nLast fall, with his top general calling for more troops, Obama launched a three-month review to re-evaluate the strategy in\nAfghanistan. \"I found that time painful,\" McChrystal tells me in one of several lengthy interviews. \"I was selling an\nunsellable position.\" For the general, it was a crash course in Beltway politics \u2014 a battle that pitted him against\nexperienced Washington insiders like Vice President Biden, who argued that a prolonged counterinsurgency campaign in\nAfghanistan would plunge America into a military quagmire without weakening international terrorist networks. \"The entire\nCOIN strategy is a fraud perpetuated on the American people,\" says Douglas Macgregor, a retired colonel and leading\ncritic of counterinsurgency who attended West Point with McChrystal. \"The idea that we are going to spend a trillion\ndollars to reshape the culture of the Islamic world is utter nonsense.\nIn the end, however, McChrystal got almost exactly what he wanted. On December 1st, in a speech at West Point, the\npresident laid out all the reasons why fighting the war in Afghanistan is a bad idea: It's expensive; we're in an economic\ncrisis; a decade-long commitment would sap American power; Al Qaeda has shifted its base of operations to Pakistan.\nThen, without ever using the words \"victory\" or \"win,\" Obama announced that he would send an additional 30,000 troops\nto Afghanistan, almost as many as McChrystal had requested. The president had thrown his weight, however hesitantly,\nbehind the counterinsurgency crowd.\nToday, as McChrystal gears up for an offensive in southern Afghanistan, the prospects for any kind of success look bleak.\nIn June, the death toll for U.S. troops passed 1,000, and the number of IEDs has doubled. Spending hundreds of billions\nof dollars on the fifth-poorest country on earth has failed to win over the civilian population, whose attitude toward U.S.\ntroops ranges from intensely wary to openly hostile. Thetiggest military operation of the year \u2014 a ferocious offensive that\nbegan in February to retake the southern town of Marja \u2014 continues to drag on, prompting McChrystal himself to refer to it\nas a \"bleeding ulcer.\" In June, Afghanistan officially outpaced Vietnam as the longest war in American history \u2014 and\nObama has quietly begun to back away from the deadline he set for withdrawing U.S. troops in July of next year. The\npresident finds himself stuck in something even more insane than a quagmire: a quagmire he knowingly walked into, even\nthough it's precisely the kind of gigantic, mind-numbing, multigenerational nation-building project he explicitly said he\ndidn't want.\nEven those who support McChrystal and his strategy of counterinsurgency know that whatever the general manages to\naccomplish in Afghanistan, it's going to look more like Vietnam than Desert Storm. \"It's not going to look like a win, smell\nlike a win or taste like a win,\" says Maj. Gen. Bill Mayville, who serves as chief of operations for McChrystal. \"This is going\nto end in an argument.\"\nThe night after his speech in Paris, McChrystal and his staff head to Kitty O'Shea's, an Irish pub catering to tourists,\naround the corner from the hotel. His wife, Annie, has joined him for a rare visit: Since the Iraq War began in 2003, she\nhas seen her husband less than 30 days a year. Though it is his and Annie's 33rd wedding anniversary, McChrystal has\ninvited his inner circle along for dinner and drinks at the \"least Gucci\" place his staff could find. His wife isn't surprised.\n\"He once took me to a Jack in the Box when I was dressed in formalwear,\" she says with a laugh.\nThe general's staff is a handpicked collection of killers, spies, geniuses, patriots, political operators and outright maniacs.\nThere's a former head of British Special Forces, two Navy Seals, an Afghan Special Forces commando, a lawyer, two\nfighter pilots and at least two dozen combat veterans and counterinsurgency experts. They jokingly refer to themselves as\nTeam America, taking the name from the South Park-esque sendup of military cluelessness, and they pride themselves\non their can-do attitude and their disdain for authority. After arriving in Kabul last summer, Team America set about\nchanging the culture of the International Security Assistance Force, as the NATO-led mission is known. (U.S. soldiers had\ntaken to deriding ISAF as short for \"I Suck at Fighting\" or \"In Sandals and Flip-Flops.\") McChrystal banned alcohol on\nbase, kicked out Burger King and other symbols of American excess, expanded the morning briefing to include thousands\nof officers and refashioned the command center into a Situational Awareness Room, a free-flowing information hub\nmodeled after Mayor Mike Bloomberg's offices in New York. He also set a manic pace for his staff, becoming legendary\nfor sleeping four hours a night, running seven miles each morning, and eating one meal a day. (In the month I spend\naround the general, I witness him eating only once.) It's a kind of superhuman narrative that has built up around him, a\nstaple in almost every media profile, as if the ability to go without sleep and food translates into the possibility of a man\nsingle-handedly winning the war.\nBy midnight at Kitty O'Shea's, much of Team America is completely shitfaced. Two officers do an Irish jig mixed with steps\nfrom a traditional Afghan wedding dance, while McChrystal's top advisers lock arms and sing a slurred song of their own\ninvention.\"Afghanistan!\" they bellow.\"Afghanistan!\" They call it their Afghanistan song.\nMcChrystal steps away from the circle, observing his team. \"All these men,\" he tells me. \"I'd die for them. And they'd die\nfor me.\"\nThe assembled men may look and sound like a bunch of combat veterans letting off steam, but in fact this tight-knit group\nrepresents the most powerful force shaping U.S. policy in Afghanistan. While McChrystal and his men are in indisputable\ncommand of all military aspects of the war, there is no equivalent position on the diplomatic or political side. Instead, an\nassortment of administration players compete over the Afghan portfolio: U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry, Special\nRepresentative to Afghanistan Richard Holbrooke, National Security Advisor Jim Jones and Secretary of State Hillary\nClinton, not to mention 40 or so other coalition ambassadors and a host of talking heads who try to insert themselves into\nthe mess, from John Kerry to John McCain. This diplomatic incoherence has effectively allowed McChrystal's team to call\nthe shots and hampered efforts to build a stable and credible government in Afghanistan. \"It jeopardizes the mission,\"\nsays Stephen Biddle, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who supports McChrystal. \"The military cannot\nby itself create governance reform.\"\nPart of the problem is structural: The Defense Department budget exceeds $600 billion a year, while the State\nDepartment receives only $50 billion. But part of the problem is personal: In private, Team McChrystal likes to talk shit\nabout many of Obama's top people on the diplomatic side. One aide calls Jim Jones, a retired four-star general and\nveteran of the Cold War, a \"clown\" who remains \"stuck in 1985.\" Politicians like McCain and Kerry, says another aide,\n\"turn up, have a meeting with Karzai, criticize him at the airport press conference, then get back for the Sunday talk\nshows. Frankly, it's not very helpful.\" Only Hillary Clinton receives good reviews from McChrystal's inner circle. \"Hillary\nhad Stan's back during the strategic review,\" says an adviser. \"She said, 'If Stan wants it, give him what he needs.'\"\nMcChrystal reserves special skepticism for Holbrooke, the official in charge of reintegrating the Taliban. \"The Boss says\nhe's like a wounded animal,\" says a member of the general's team. \"Holbrooke keeps hearing rumors that he's going to\nget fired, so that makes him dangerous. He's a brilliant guy, but he just comes in, pulls on a lever, whatever he can grasp\nonto. But this is COIN, and you can't just have someone yanking on shit.\"\nAt one point on his trip to Paris, McChrystal checks his BlackBerry. \"Oh, not another e-mail from Holbrooke,\" he groans. \"I\ndon't even want to open it.\" He clicks on the message and reads the salutation out loud, then stuffs the BladkBerry back in\nhis pocket, not bothering to conceal his annoyance.\n\"Make sure you don't get any of that on your leg,\" an aide jokes, referring to the e-mail.\nBy far the most crucial \u2014 and strained \u2014 relationship is between McChrystal and Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador.\nAccording to those close to the two men, Eikenberry \u2014 a retired three-star general who served in Afghanistan in 2002 and\n2005 \u2014 can't stand that his former subordinate is now calling the shots. He's also furious that McChrystal, backed by\nNATO's allies, refused to put Eikenberry in the pivotal role of viceroy in Afghanistan, which would have made him the\ndiplomatic equivalent of the general. The job instead went to British Ambassador Mark Sedwill \u2014 a move that effectively\nincreased McChrystal's influence over diplomacy by shutting out a powerful rival. \"In reality, that position needs to be filled\nby an American for it to have weight,\" says a U.S. official familiar with the negotiations.\nThe relationship was further strained in January, when a classified cable that Eikenberry wrote was leaked to The New\nYork Times. The cable was as scathing as it was prescient. The ambassador offered a brutal critique of McChrystal's\nstrategy, dismissed President Hamid Karzai as \"not an adequate strategic partner,\" and cast doubt on whether the\ncounterinsurgency plan would be \"sufficient\" to deal with Al Qaeda. \"We will become more deeply engaged here with no\nway to extricate ourselves,\" Eikenberry warned, \"short of allowing the country to descend again into lawlessness and\nchaos.\"\nMcChrystal and his team were blindsided by the cable. \"I like Karl, I've known him for years, but they'd never said\nanything like that to us before,\" says McChrystal, who adds that he felt \"betrayed\" by the leak. \"Here's one that covers his\nflank for the history books. Now if we fail, they can say, 'I told you so.'\"\nThe most striking example of McChrystal's usurpation of diplomatic policy is his handling of Karzai. It is McChrystal, not\ndiplomats like Eikenberry or Holbrooke, who enjoys the best relationship with the man America is relying on to lead\nAfghanistan. The doctrine of counterinsurgency requires a credible government, and since Karzai is not considered\ncredible by his own people, McChrystal has worked hard to make him so. Over the past few months, he has accompanied\nthe president on more than 10 trips around the country, standing beside him at political meetings, or shuras, in Kandahar.\nIn February, the day before the doomed offensive in Marja, McChrystal even drove over to the president's palace to get\nhim to sign off on what would be the largest military operation of the year. Karzai's staff, however, insisted that the\npresident was sleeping off a cold and could not be disturbed. After several hours of haggling, McChrystal finally enlisted\nthe aid of Afghanistan's defense minister, who persuaded Karzai's people to wake the president from his nap.\nThis is one of the central flaws with McChrystal's counterinsurgency strategy: The need to build a credible government\nputs us at the mercy of whatever tin-pot leader we've backed \u2014 a danger that Eikenberry explicitly warned about in his\ncable. Even Team McChrystal privately acknowledges that Karzai is a less-than-ideal partner. \"He's been locked up in his\npalace the past year,\" laments one of the general's top advisers. At times, Karzai himself has actively undermined\nMcChrystal's desire to put him in charge. During a recent visit to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Karzai met three U.S.\nsoldiers who had been wounded in Uruzgan province. \"General,\" he called out to McChrystal, \"I didn't even know we were\nfighting in Uruzgan!\"\nGrowing up as a military brat, McChrystal exhibited the mixture of brilliance and cockiness that would follow him\nthroughout his career. His father fought in Korea and Vietnam, retiring as a two-star general, and his four brothers all\njoined the armed services. Moving around to different bases, McChrystal took solace in baseball, a sport in which he\nmade no pretense of hiding his superiority: In Little League, he would call out strikes to the crowd before whipping a\nfastball down the middle.\nMcChrystal entered West Point in 1972, when the U.S. military was close to its all-time low in popularity. His class was the\nlast to graduate before the academy started to admit women. The \"Prison on the Hudson,\" as it was known then, was a\npotent mix of testosterone, hooliganism and reactionary patriotism. Cadets repeatedly trashed the mess hall in food fights,\nand birthdays were celebrated with a tradition called \"rat fucking,\" which often left the birthday boy outside in the snow or\nmud, covered in shaving cream. \"It was pretty out of control,\" says Lt. Gen. David Barno, a classmate who went on to\nserve as the top commander in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005. The class, filled with what Barno calls \"huge talent\" and\n\"wild-eyed teenagers with a strong sense of idealism,\" also produced Gen. Ray Odierno, the current commander of U.S.\nforces in Iraq.\nThe son of a general, McChrystal was also a ringleader of the campus dissidents \u2014 a dual role that taught him how to\nthrive in a rigid, top-down environment while thumbing his nose at authority every chance he got. He accumulated more\nthan 100 hours of demerits for drinking, partying and insubordination \u2014 a record that his classmates boasted made him a\n\"century man.\" One classmate, who asked not to be named, recalls finding McChrystal passed out in the shower after\ndowning a case of beer he had hidden under the sink. The troublemaking almost got him kicked out, and he spent hours\nsubjected to forced marches in the Area, a paved courtyard where unruly cadets were disciplined. \"I'd come visit, and I'd\nend up spending most of my time in the library, while Stan was in the Area,\" recalls Annie, who began dating McChrystal\nin 1973.\nMcChrystal wound up ranking 298 out of a class of 855, a serious underachievement for a man widely regarded as\nbrilliant. His most compelling work was extracurricular: As managing editor of The Pointer, the West Point literary\nmagazine, McChrystal wrote seven short stories that eerily foreshadow many of the issues he would confront in his\ncareer. In one tale, a fictional officer complains about the difficulty of training foreign troops to fight; in another, a 19-year-\nold soldier kills a boy he mistakes for a terrorist. In \"Brinkman's Note,\" a piece of suspense fiction, the unnamed narrator\nappears to be trying to stop a plot to assassinate the president. It turns out, however, that the narrator himself is the\nassassin, and he's able to infiltrate the White House: \"The President strode in smiling. From the right coat pocket of the\nraincoat I carried, I slowly drew forth my 32-caliber pistol. In Brinkman's failure, I had succeeded.\"\nAfter graduation, 2nd Lt. Stanley McChrystal entered an Army that was all but broken in the wake of Vietnam. \"We really\nfelt we were a peacetime generation,\" he recalls. \"There was the Gulf War, but even that didn't feel like that big of a deal.\"\nSo McChrystal spent his career where the action was: He enrolled in Special Forces school and became a regimental\ncommander of the 3rd Ranger Battalion in 1986. It was a dangerous position, even in peacetime \u2014 nearly two dozen\nRangers were killed in training accidents during the Eighties. It was also an unorthodox career path: Most soldiers who\nwant to climb the ranks to general don't go into the Rangers. Displaying a penchant for transforming systems he considers\noutdated, McChrystal set out to revolutionize the training regime for the Rangers. He introduced mixed martial arts,\nrequired every soldier to qualify with night-vision goggles on the rifle range and forced troops to build up their endurance\nwith weekly marches involving heavy backpacks.\nIn the late 1990s, McChrystal shrewdly improved his inside game, spending a year at Harvard's Kennedy School of\nGovernment and then at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he co-authored a treatise on the merits and drawbacks\nof humanitarian interventionism. But as he moved up through the ranks, McChrystal relied on the skills he had learned as\na troublemaking kid at West Point: knowing precisely how far he could go in a rigid military hierarchy without getting\ntossed out. Being a highly intelligent badass, he discovered, could take you far \u2014 especially in the political chaos that\nfollowed September 11th. \"He was very focused,\" says Annie. \"Even as a young officer he seemed to know what he\nwanted to do. I don't think his personality has changed in all these years.\"\nBy some accounts, McChrystal's career should have been over at least two times by now. As Pentagon spokesman\nduring the invasion of Iraq, the general seemed more like a White House mouthpiece than an up-and-coming commander\nwith a reputation for speaking his mind. When Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld made his infamous \"stuff happens\"\nremark during the looting of Baghdad, McChrystal backed him up. A few days later, he echoed the president's Mission\nAccomplished gaffe by insisting that major combat operations in Iraq were over. But it was during his next stint \u2014\noverseeing the military's most elite units, including the Rangers, Navy Seals and Delta Force \u2014 that McChrystal took part\nin a cover-up that would have destroyed the career of a lesser man.\nAfter Cpl. Pat Tillman, the former-NFL-star-turned-Ranger, was accidentally killed by his own troops in Afghanistan in April\n2004, McChrystal took an active role in creating the impression that Tillman had died at the hands of Taliban fighters. He\nsigned off on a falsified recommendation for a Silver Star that suggested Tillman had been killed by enemy fire.\n(McChrystal would later claim he didn't read the recommendation closely enough \u2014 a strange excuse for a commander\nknown for his laserlike attention to minute details.) A week later, McChrystal sent a memo up the chain of command,\nspecifically warning that President Bush should avoid mentioning the cause of Tillman's death. \"If the circumstances of\nCorporal Tillman's death become public,\" he wrote, it could cause \"public embarrassment\" for the president.\n\"The false narrative, which McChrystal clearly helped construct, diminished Pat's true actions,\" wrote Tillman's mother,\nMary, in her book Boots on the Ground by Dusk. McChrystal got away with it, she added, because he was the \"golden\nboy\" of Rumsfeld and Bush, who loved his willingness to get things done, even if it included bending the rules or skipping\nthe chain of command. Nine days after Tillman's death, McChrystal was promoted to major general.\nTwo years later, in 2006, McChrystal was tainted by a scandal involving detainee abuse and torture at Camp Nama in\nIraq. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, prisoners at the camp were subjected to a now-familiar litany of\nabuse: stress positions, being dragged naked through the mud. McChrystal was not disciplined in the scandal, even\nthough an interrogator at the camp reported seeing him inspect the prison multiple times. But the experience was so\nunsettling to McChrystal that he tried to prevent detainee operations from being placed under his command in\nAfghanistan, viewing them as a \"political swamp,\" according to a U.S. official. In May 2009, as McChrystal prepared for\nhis confirmation hearings, his staff prepared him for hard questions about Camp Nama and the Tillman cover-up. But the\nscandals barely made a ripple in Congress, and McChrystal was soon on his way back to Kabul to run the war in\nAfghanistan.\nThe media, to a large extent, have also given McChrystal a pass on both controversies. Where Gen. Petraeus is kind of a\ndweeb, a teacher's pet with a Ranger's tab, McChrystal is a snake-eating rebel, a \"Jedi\" commander, as Newsweek called\nhim. He didn't care when his teenage son came home with blue hair and a mohawk. He speaks his mind with a candor\nrare for a high-ranking official. He asks for opinions, and seems genuinely interested in the response. He gets briefings on\nhis iPod and listens to books on tape. He carries a custom-made set of nunchucks in his convoy engraved with his name\nand four stars, and his itinerary often bears a fresh quote from Bruce Lee. (\"There are no limits. There are only plateaus,\nand you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.\") He went out on dozens of nighttime raids during his time in Iraq,\nunprecedented for a top commander, and turned up on missions unannounced, with almost no entourage. \"The fucking\nlads love Stan McChrystal,\" says a British officer who serves in Kabul. \"You'd be out in Somewhere, Iraq, and someone\nwould take a knee beside you, and a corporal would be like 'Who the fuck is that?' And it's fucking Stan McChrystal.\"\nIt doesn't hurt that McChrystal was also extremely successful as head of the Joint Special Operations Command, the elite\nforces that carry out the government's darkest ops. During the Iraq surge, his team killed and captured thousands of\ninsurgents, including Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq. \"JSOC was a killing machine,\" says Maj. Gen.\nMayville, his chief of operations. McChrystal was also open to new ways of killing. He systematically mapped out terrorist\nnetworks, targeting specific insurgents and hunting them down \u2014 often with the help of cyberfreaks traditionally shunned\nby the military. \"The Boss would find the 24-year-old kid with a nose ring, with some fucking brilliant degree from MIT,\nsitting in the corner with 16 computer monitors humming,\" says a Special Forces commando who worked with McChrystal\nin Iraq and now serves on his staff in Kabul. \"He'd say, 'Hey \u2014 you fucking muscleheads couldn't find lunch without help.\nYou got to work together with these guys.'\"\nEven in his new role as America's leading evangelist for counterinsurgency, McChrystal retains the deep-seated instincts\nof a terrorist hunter. To put pressure on the Taliban, he has upped the number of Special Forces units in Afghanistan from\nfour to 19. \"You better be out there hitting four or five targets tonight,\" McChrystal will tell a Navy Seal he sees in the\nhallway at headquarters. Then he'll add, \"I'm going to have to scold you in the morning for it, though.\" In fact, the general\nfrequently finds himself apologizing for the disastrous consequences of counterinsurgency. In the first four months of this\nyear, NATO forces killed some 90 civilians, up 76 percent from the same period in 2009 \u2014 a record that has created\ntremendous resentment among the very population that COIN theory is intent on winning over. In February, a Special\nForces night raid ended in the deaths of two pregnant Afghan women and allegations of a cover-up, and in April, protests\nerupted in Kandahar after U.S. forces accidentally shot up a bus, killing five Afghans. \"We've shot an amazing number of\npeople,\" McChrystal recently conceded.\nDespite the tragedies and miscues, McChrystal has issued some of the strictest directives to avoid civilian casualties that\nthe U.S. military has ever encountered in a war zone. It's \"insurgent math,\" as he calls it \u2014 for every innocent person you\nkill, you create 10 new enemies. He has ordered convoys to curtail their reckless driving, put restrictions on the use of air\npower and severely limited night raids. He regularly apologizes to Hamid Karzai when civilians are killed, and berates\ncommanders responsible for civilian deaths. \"For a while,\" says one U.S. official, \"the most dangerous place to be in\nAfghanistan was in front of McChrystal after a 'civ cas' incident.\" The ISAF command has even discussed ways to make\nnot killing into something you can win an award for: There's talk of creating a new medal for \"courageous restraint,\" a\nbuzzword that's unlikely to gain much traction in the gung-ho culture of the U.S. military.\nBut however strategic they may be, McChrystal's new marching orders have caused an intense backlash among his own\ntroops. Being told to hold their fire, soldiers complain, puts them in greater danger. \"Bottom line?\" says a former Special\nForces operator who has spent years in Iraq and Afghanistan. \"I would love to kick McChrystal in the nuts. His rules of\nengagement put soldiers' lives in even greater danger. Every real soldier will tell you the same thing.\"\nIn March, McChrystal traveled to Combat Outpost JFM \u2014 a small encampment on the outskirts of Kandahar \u2014 to confront\nsuch accusations from the troops directly. It was a typically bold move by the general. Only two days earlier, he had\nreceived an e-mail from Israel Arroyo, a 25-year-old staff sergeant who asked McChrystal to go on a mission with his unit.\n\"I am writing because it was said you don't care about the troops and have made it harder to defend ourselves,\" Arroyo\nwrote.\nWithin hours, McChrystal responded personally: \"I'm saddened by the accusation that I don't care about soldiers, as it is\nsomething I suspect any soldier takes both personally and professionally \u2014 at least I do. But I know perceptions depend\nupon your perspective at the time, and I respect that every soldier's view is his own.\" Then he showed up at Arroyo's\noutpost and went on a foot patrol with the troops \u2014 not some bullshit photo-op stroll through a market, but a real live\noperation in a dangerous war zone.\nSix weeks later, just before McChrystal returned from Paris, the general received another e-mail from Arroyo. A 23-year-\nold corporal named Michael Ingram \u2014 one of the soldiers McChrystal had gone on patrol with \u2014 had been killed by an IED\na day earlier. It was the third man the 25-member platoon had lost in a year, and Arroyo was writing to see if the general\nwould attend Ingram's memorial service. \"He started to look up to you,\" Arroyo wrote. McChrystal said he would try to\nmake it down to pay his respects as soon as possible.\nThe night before the general is scheduled to visit Sgt. Arroyo's platoon for the memorial, I arrive at Combat Outpost JFM\nto speak with the soldiers he had gone on patrol with. JFM is a small encampment, ringed by high blast walls and guard\ntowers. Almost all of the soldiers here have been on repeated combat tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and have seen\nsome of the worst fighting of both wars. But they are especially angered by Ingram's death. His commanders had\nrepeatedly requested permission to tear down the house where Ingram was killed, noting that it was often used as a\ncombat position by the Taliban. But due to McChrystal's new restrictions to avoid upsetting civilians, the request had been\ndenied. \"These were abandoned houses,\" fumes Staff Sgt. Kennith Hicks. \"Nobody was coming back to live in them.\"\nOne soldier shows me the list of new regulations the platoon was given. \"Patrol only in areas that you are reasonably\ncertain that you will not have to defend yourselves with lethal force,\" the laminated card reads. For a soldier who has\ntraveled halfway around the world to fight, that's like telling a cop he should only patrol in areas where he knows he won't\nhave to make arrests. \"Does that make any fucking sense?\" asks Pfc. Jared Pautsch. \"We should just drop a fucking\nbomb on this place. You sit and ask yourself: What are we doing here?\"\nThe rules handed out here are not what McChrystal intended \u2014 they've been distorted as they passed through the chain of\ncommand \u2014 but knowing that does nothing to lessen the anger of troops on the ground. \"Fuck, when I came over here and\nheard that McChrystal was in charge, I thought we would get our fucking gun on,\" says Hicks, who has served three tours\nof combat. \"I get COIN. I get all that. McChrystal comes here, explains it, it makes sense. But then he goes away on his\nbird, and by the time his directives get passed down to us through Big Army, they're all fucked up \u2014 either because\nsomebody is trying to cover their ass, or because they just don't understand it themselves. But we're fucking losing this\nthing.\"\nMcChrystal and his team show up the next day. Underneath a tent, the general has a 45-minute discussion with some two\ndozen soldiers. The atmosphere is tense. \"I ask you what's going on in your world, and I think it's important for you all to\nunderstand the big picture as well,\" McChrystal begins. \"How's the company doing? You guys feeling sorry for\nyourselves? Anybody? Anybody feel like you're losing?\" McChrystal says.\n\"Sir, some of the guys here, sir, think we're losing, sir,\" says Hicks.\nMcChrystal nods. \"Strength is leading when you just don't want to lead,\" he tells the men. \"You're leading by example.\nThat's what we do. Particularly when it's really, really hard, and it hurts inside.\" Then he spends 20 minutes talking about\ncounterinsurgency, diagramming his concepts and principles on a whiteboard. He makes COIN seem like common sense,\nbut he's careful not to bullshit the men. \"We are knee-deep in the decisive year,\" he tells them. The Taliban, he insists, no\nlonger has the initiative \u2014 \"but I don't think we do, either.\" It's similar to the talk he gave in Paris, but it's not winning any\nhearts and minds among the soldiers. \"This is the philosophical part that works with think tanks,\" McChrystal tries to joke.\n\"But it doesn't get the same reception from infantry companies.\"\nDuring the question-and-answer period, the frustration boils over. The soldiers complain about not being allowed to use\nlethal force, about watching insurgents they detain be freed for lack of evidence. They want to be able to fight \u2014 like they\ndid in Iraq, like they had in Afghanistan before McChrystal. 'We aren't putting fear into the Taliban,\" one soldier says.\n\"Winning hearts and minds in COIN is a coldblooded thing,\" McChrystal says, citing an oft-repeated maxim that you can't\nkill your way out of Afghanistan. \"The Russians killed 1 million Afghans, and that didn't work.\"\n\"I'm not saying go out and kill everybody, sir,\" the soldier persists. \"You say we've stopped the momentum of the\ninsurgency. I don't believe that's true in this area. The more we pull back, the more we restrain ourselves, the stronger it's\ngetting.\"\n\"I agree with you,\" McChrystal says. \"In this area, we've not made progress, probably. You have to show strength here,\nyou have to use fire. What I'm telling you is, fire costs you. What do you want to do? You want to wipe the population out\nhere and resettle it?\"\nA soldier complains that under the rules, any insurgent who doesn't have a weapon is immediately assumed to be a\ncivilian. \"That's the way this game is,\" McChrystal says. \"It's complex. I can't just decide: It's shirts and skins, and we'll kill\nall the shirts.\"\nAs the discussion ends, McChrystal seems to sense that he hasn't succeeded at easing the men's anger. He makes one\nlast-ditch effort to reach them, acknowledging the death of Cpl. Ingram. \"There's no way I can make that easier,\" he tells\nthem. \"No way I can pretend it won't hurt. No way I can tell you not to feel that. . . . I will tell you, you're doing a great job.\nDon't let the frustration get to you.\" The session ends with no clapping, and no real resolution. McChrystal may have sold\nPresident Obama on counterinsurgency, but many of his own men aren't buying it.\nWhen it comes to Afghanistan, history is not on McChrystal's side. The only foreign invader to have any success here\nwas Genghis Khan \u2014 and he wasn't hampered by things like human rights, economic development and press scrutiny.\nThe COIN doctrine, bizarrely, draws inspiration from some of the biggest Western military embarrassments in recent\nmemory: France's nasty war in Algeria (lost in 1962) and the American misadventure in Vietnam (lost in 1975).\nMcChrystal, like other advocates of COIN, readily acknowledges that counterinsurgency campaigns are inherently messy,\nexpensive and easy to lose. \"Even Afghans are confused by Afghanistan,\" he says. But even if he somehow manages to\nsucceed, after years of bloody fighting with Afghan kids who pose no threat to the U.S. homeland, the war will do little to\nshut down Al Qaeda, which has shifted its operations to Pakistan. Dispatching 150,000 troops to build new schools,\nroads, mosques and water-treatment facilities around Kandahar is like trying to stop the drug war in Mexico by occupying\nArkansas and building Baptist churches in Little Rock. \"It's all very cynical, politically,\" says Marc Sageman, a former CIA\ncase officer who has extensive experience in the region. \"Afghanistan is not in our vital interest \u2014 there's nothing for us\nthere.\"\nIn mid-May, two weeks after visiting the troops in Kandahar, McChrystal travels to the White House for a high-level visit by\nHamid Karzai. It is a triumphant moment for the general, one that demonstrates he is very much in command \u2014 both in\nKabul and in Washington. In the East Room, which is packed with journalists and dignitaries, President Obama sings the\npraises of Karzai. The two leaders talk about how great their relationship is, about the pain they feel over civilian\ncasualties. They mention the word \"progress\" 16 times in under an hour. But there is no mention of victory. Still, the \u2022\nsession represents the most forceful commitment that Obama has made to McChrystal's strategy in months. \"There is no\ndenying the progress that the Afghan people have made in recent years \u2014 in education, in health care and economic\ndevelopment,\" the president says. \"As I saw in the lights across Kabul when I landed \u2014 lights that would not have been\nvisible just a few years earlier.\"\nIt is a disconcerting observation for Obama to make. During the worst years in Iraq, when the Bush administration had no\nreal progress to point to, officials used to offer up the exact same evidence of success. \"It was one of our first\nimpressions,\" one GOP official said in 2006, after landing in Baghdad at the height of the sectarian violence. \"So many\nlights shining brightly.\" So it is to the language of the Iraq War that the Obama administration has turned \u2014 talk of\nprogress, of city lights, of metrics like health care and education. Rhetoric that just a few years ago they would have\nmocked. \"They are trying to manipulate perceptions because there is no definition of victory \u2014 because victory is not even\ndefined or recognizable,\" says Celeste Ward, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation who served as a political\nadviser to U.S. commanders in Iraq in 2006. \"That's the game we're in right now. What we need, for strategic purposes, is\nto create the perception that we didn't get run off. The facts on the ground are not great, and are not going to become\ngreat in the near future.\"\nBut facts on the ground, as history has proven, offer little deterrent to a military determined to stay the course. Even those\nclosest to McChrystal know that the rising anti-war sentiment at home doesn't begin to reflect how deeply fucked up things\nare in Afghanistan. \"If Americans pulled back and started paying attention to this war, it would become even less popular,\"\na senior adviser to McChrystal says. Such realism, however, doesn't prevent advocates of counterinsurgency from\ndreaming big: Instead of beginning to withdraw troops next year, as Obama promised, the military hopes to ramp up its\ncounterinsurgency campaign even further. \"There's a possibility we could ask for another surge of U.S. forces next\nsummer if we see success here,\" a senior military official in Kabul tells me.\nBack in Afghanistan, less than a month after the White House meeting with Karzai and all the talk of \"progress,\"\nMcChrystal is hit by the biggest blow to his vision of counterinsurgency. Since last year, the Pentagon had been planning\nto launch a major military operation this summer in Kandahar, the country's second-largest city and the Taliban's original\nhome base. It was supposed to be a decisive turning point in the war \u2014 the primary reason for the troop surge that\nMcChrystal wrested from Obama late last year. But on June 10th, acknowledging that the military still needs to lay more\ngroundwork, the general announced that he is postponing the offensive until the fall. Rather than one big battle, like\nFallujah or Ramadi, U.S. troops will implement what McChrystal calls a \"rising tide of security.\" The Afghan police and\narmy will enter Kandahar to attempt to seize control of neighborhoods, while the U.S. pours $90 million of aid into the city\nto win over the civilian population.\nEven proponents of counterinsurgency are hard-pressed to explain the new plan. \"This isn't a classic operation,\" says a\nU.S. military official. \"It's not going to be Black Hawk Down. There aren't going to be doors kicked in.\" Other U.S. officials\ninsist that doors are going to be kicked in, but that it's going to be a kinder, gentler offensive than the disaster in Marja.\n\"The Taliban have a jackboot on the city,\" says a military official. \"We have to remove them, but we have to do it in a way\nthat doesn't alienate the population.\" When Vice President Biden was briefed on the new plan in the Oval Office, insiders\nsay he was shocked to see how much it mirrored the more gradual plan of counterterrorism that he advocated last fall.\n\"This looks like CT-plus!\" he said, according to U.S. officials familiar with the meeting.\nWhatever the nature of the new plan, the delay underscores the fundamental flaws of counterinsurgency. After nine years\nof war, the Taliban simply remains too strongly entrenched for the U.S. military to openly attack. The very people that\nCOIN seeks to win over \u2014 the Afghan people \u2014 do not want us there. Our supposed ally, President Karzai, used his\ninfluence to delay the offensive, and the massive influx of aid championed by McChrystal is likely only to make things\nworse. \"Throwing money at the problem exacerbates the problem,\" says Andrew Wilder, an expert at Tufts University who\nhas studied the effect of aid in southern Afghanistan. \"A tsunami of cash fuels corruption, delegitimizes the government\nand creates an environment where we're picking winners and losers\" \u2014 a process that fuels resentment and hostility\namong the civilian population. So far, counterinsurgency has succeeded only in creating a never-ending demand for the\nprimary product supplied by the military: perpetual war. There is a reason that President Obama studiously avoids using\nthe word \"victory\" when he talks about Afghanistan. Winning, it would seem, is not really possible. Not even with\nStanley McChrystal in charge.\nThis article originally appeared in RS 1108/1109 from July 8-22, 2010.", "nbr_mention": 3, "sentiment": 1, "sentence": "\nthe coin doctrine, bizarrely, draws inspiration from some of the biggest western military embarrassments in recent\nmemory: france's nasty war in algeria (lost in 1962) and the american misadventure in vietnam (lost in 1975)"}, "Austria": {"mention": ["vienna", "vienna", "vienna", "austria", "austria", "austria", "austria", "austria", "austria", "austria"], "text": "Attached is full compilation.

As we work to\nsecure our personnel and facilities, we have confirmed that one of our State Department officers\nwas killed. We are heartbroken by this terrible loss. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family\nand those who have suffered in this attack.\nThis evening, I called Libyan President Magariaf to coordinate additional support to protect\nAmericans in Libya. President Magariaf expressed his condemnation and condolences and\npledged his government's full cooperation.\nSome have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted\non the Internet. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs\nof others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation.\nBut let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.\nIn light of the events of today, the United States government is working with partner countries\naround the world to protect our personnel, our missions, and American citizens worldwide.\nStatement on the Death of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya\nSeptember 12, 2012\nIt is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel in\nBenghazi, Libya yesterday. Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens\nand Foreign Service Information Management Officer, Sean Smith. We are still making next of\nkin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all their families and\ncolleagues.\nA 21 year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he\nsustained in the attack on our office in Benghazi.\nI had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke\neloquently about his passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This\nassignment was only the latest in his more than two decades of dedication to advancing closer\nties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a Peace Corps\nVolunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans\non the ground in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to\nbuild the foundation for a new, free nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work\nthat he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's values and interests, even when\nthat meant putting himself in danger.\nSean Smith was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten years ago.

Prior to arriving in Benghazi, he served in Baghdad, Pretoria,\nMontreal, and most recently The Hague.\nAll the Americans we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this\nvicious and violent attack that took their lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan\npeople reach for a better future.\nAmerica's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country.\nWe are honored by the service of each and every one of them.\nRemarks on the Deaths of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya\nSeptember 12, 2012\nYesterday, our U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya was attacked. Heavily armed militants\nassaulted the compound and set fire to our buildings. American and Libyan security personnel\nbattled the attackers together. Four Americans were killed. They included Sean Smith, a Foreign\nService information management officer, and our Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. We are\nstill making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals.\nThis is an attack that should shock the conscience of people of all faiths around the world. We\ncondemn in the strongest terms this senseless act of violence, and we send our prayers to the\nfamilies, friends, and colleagues of those we've lost.\nAll over the world, every day, America's diplomats and development experts risk their lives in\nthe service of our country and our values, because they believe that the United States must be a\nforce for peace and progress in the world, that these aspirations are worth striving and sacrificing\nfor. Alongside our men and women in uniform, they represent the best traditions of a bold and\ngenerous nation.\nIn the lobby of this building, the State Department, the names of those who have fallen in the line\nof duty are inscribed in marble. Our hearts break over each one. And now, because of this\ntragedy, we have new heroes to honor and more friends to mourn.\nChris Stevens fell in love with the Middle East as a young Peace Corps volunteer teaching\nEnglish in Morocco. He joined the Foreign Service, learned languages, won friends for America\nin distant places, and made other people's hopes his own.\nIn the early days of the Libyan revolution, I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition.\nHe arrived on a cargo ship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships with\nLibya's revolutionaries. He risked his life to stop a tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a\nbetter Libya. The world needs more Chris Stevenses.

He spent 10 years as an information management officer\nin the State Department, he was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary\nassignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather, with whom I spoke this morning. He was a\nfather to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being proud of the\nservice their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and\nfinally to Benghazi.\nThe mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary,\nand we and the people of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy.\nToday, many Americans are asking \u2014 indeed, I asked myself\u2014 how could this happen? How\ncould this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from destruction?\nThis question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be.\nBut we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group \u2014\nnot the people or Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a\ncountry scarred by war and tyranny, they were hailed as friends and partners. And when the\nattack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post. Some were wounded.\nLibyans carried Chris' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to\nsafety. And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the\nviolence and pledged every effort to protect our people and pursue those responsible.\nThe friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty\nof this attack. A free and stable Libya is still in America's interest and security, and we will not\nturn our back on that, nor will we rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and\nbrought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities to move swiftly and\nsurely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American\nembassies, consulates, and citizens.\nThere will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher\npriority than protecting our men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine\nthe precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault. Some have sought to\njustify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our Embassy in Cairo\nyesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the intemet. America's commitment\nto religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear \u2014 there is\nno justification for this, none. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long\nas there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a\ntrue and lasting peace.\nIt is especially difficult that this happened on September I I th. It's an anniversary that means a\ngreat deal to all Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet\nfinished, that the job of putting an end to violent extremism and building a safe and stable world\ncontinues. But September 11th means even more than that.

Doherty in Benghazi, Libya\nSeptember 13, 2012\nThe attack on our diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya on Tuesday claimed the lives of four\nAmericans. Yesterday, I spoke about two: Ambassador Chris Stevens and Information\nManagement Officer Sean Smith. Today, we also recognize the two security personnel who died\nhelping protect their colleagues. Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty were both decorated\nmilitary veterans who served our country with honor and distinction. Our thoughts, prayers, and\ndeepest gratitude are with their families and friends. Our embassies could not carry on our\ncritical work around the world without the service and sacrifice of brave people like Tyrone and\nGlen.\nTyrone's friends and colleagues called him \"Rone,\" and they relied on his courage and skill,\nhoned over two decades as a Navy SEAL. In uniform, he served multiple tours in Iraq and\nAfghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in dangerous posts from\nCentral America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well as the arm of a warrior,\nearning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. All our hearts go out to\nTyrone's wife Dorothy and his three sons, Tyrone Jr., Hunter, and Kai, who was born just a few\nmonths ago.\nWe also grieve for Glen Doherty, called Bub, and his family: his father Bernard, his mother\nBarbara, his brother Gregory, and his sister Kathleen. Glen was also a former Navy SEAL and an\nexperienced paramedic. And he put his life on the line many times, protecting Americans in Iraq,\nAfghanistan, and other hotspots. In the end, he died the way he lived \u2014 with selfless honor and\nunstinting valor.\nWe condemn the attack that took the lives of these heroes in the strongest terms, and we are\ntaking additional steps to safeguard American embassies, consulates, and citizens around the\nworld. This violence should shock the conscience of people of all faiths and traditions.

Well, let me welcome our friends and colleagues\nfrom Morocco here to the Benjamin Franklin Room on the eighth floor of the State Department\nfor this very important first session of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue. Before I begin to\naddress the significance of this Strategic Dialogue and the next step in our long relations with\nMorocco, I want to say a few words about the events unfolding in the world today.\nWe are closely watching what is happening in Yemen and elsewhere, and we certainly hope and\nexpect that there will be steps taken to avoid violence and prevent the escalation of protests into\nviolence.\nI also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to these\nprotests in a number of countries. Let me state very clearly \u2014 and I hope it is obvious \u2014 that the\nUnited States Government had absolutely nothing to do with this video. We absolutely reject its\ncontent and message. America's commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very\nbeginning of our nation. And as you know, we are home to people of all religions, many of\nwhom came to this country seeking the right to exercise their own religion, including, of course,\nmillions of Muslims. And we have the greatest respect for people of faith.\nTo us, to me personally, this video is disgusting and reprehensible. It appears to have a deeply\ncynical purpose: to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage. But as I said yesterday, there\nis no justification, none at all, for responding to this video with violence, We condemn the\nviolence that has resulted in the strongest terms, and we greatly appreciate that many Muslims in\nthe United States and around the world have spoken out on this issue.\nViolence, we believe, has no place in religion and is no way to honor religion. Islam, like other\nreligions, respects the fundamental dignity of human beings, and it is a violation of that\nfundamental dignity to wage attacks on innocents. As long as there are those who are willing to\nshed blood and take innocent life in the name of religion, the name of God, the world will never\nknow a true and lasting peace. It is especially wrong for violence to be directed against\ndiplomatic missions. These are places whose very purpose is peaceful: to promote better\nunderstuiding across countries and cultures. All governments have a responsibility to protect\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Now, I would\nnote that in today's world with today's technologies, that is impossible. But even if it were\npossible, our country does have a long tradition of free expression which is enshrined in our\nConstitution and our law, and we do not stop individual citizens from expressing their views no\nmatter how distasteful they may be.\nThere are, of course, different views around the world about the outer limits of free speech and\nfree expression, but there should be no debate about the simple proposition that violence in\nresponse to speech is not acceptable. We all \u2014 whether we are leaders in government, leaders in\ncivil society or religious leaders \u2014 must draw the line at violence. And any responsible leader\nshould be standing up now and drawing that line.\nI wanted to begin with this statement, because, as our Moroccan friends and all of you know, this\nhas been a difficult week at the State Department. I very much appreciate, Minister, the\ncondolences your government expressed to our Embassy in Rabat And even though that tragedy\nhappened far away in Benghazi, we found a reminder of the deep bounds that connect Morocco\nto the United States. It was in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco that one of the Americans\nwe lost this week, Ambassador Chris Stevens, fell in love with the region when he served as a\nPeace Corps volunteer there. That experience set him on a decades-long career of service. So in\nthe memory of fallen friends and colleagues, let us remind ourselves of the many ways in which\nriot just our governments but the people of our two nations have worked together to build a better\nfuture.\nIn many ways, the United States looks to Morocco to be a leader and a model. His Majesty King\nMohammed deserves great credit for the work you've undertaken. In fact, after my visit to Rabat\nearlier this year. I told my team: \"We need to start a Strategic Dialogue with Morocco.\" No\ncountry has been a friend of the United States longer than Morocco. You were the first nation to\nrecognize us back in 1777. But we're not satisfied with simply having a friendship that is\nlongstanding We want one that is dynamic, growing, looking toward the future. So let me\nhighlight a few of the areas we should focus on today.\nOn political reform, we have all seen remarkable changes taking place across North Africa and\nthe Middle East. I commend Morocco and your government for your efforts to stay ahead of\nthese changes by holding free and fair elections, empowering the elected parliament, taking other\nsteps to ensure that the government reflects the will of the people. Today, our political working\ngroup will discuss how the United States can continue to support your efforts to translate\ncommitments into actions. Because as we all know, democracy, real reform, require that people\nthemselves feel the changes in their evetyday lives: the courts reformed, the government more\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

We know that child brides are less likely to get an education, more likely to face\nlife-threatening problems, particularly around child birth and delivery, which not only\nshortchanges them but can even rob them and their communities of their lives and talents. So we\nwant to encourage the government and civil society to continue their important work together on\nthis issue.\nWith regard to the Western Sahara, the United States continues to support efforts to find a\npeaceful, sustainable, mutually agreed-upon solution. U.S. policy toward the Western Sahara has\nremained consistent for many years. We have made clear that Morocco's autonomy plan is\nserious, realistic, and credible, and that it represents a potential approach that could satisfy the\naspirations of the people in the Western Sahara to run their own affairs in peace and dignity. We\ncontinue to support the negotiations carried out by the United Nations and hope parties can work\ntoward resolution.\nWith respect to the economy, our second working group will focus on what more can be done to\ndeliver tangible economic benefits. Morocco's economy is relatively healthy, but you face the\nsame problem that is now endemic across the world \u2014 unemployment is still too high, especially\namong young people.\nThat's why the United States is providing $1.5 million to support an effort to attract foreign\ninvestors, foster local economic development, and combat corruption across the region. And I'm\npleased to announce that later this year we will hold a Morocco business development\nconference here in Washington to connect businesses from both countries.\nToday, we should discuss ways to build on all of these efforts by increasing bilateral trade, a\nparticular goal of mine since so much trade from Morocco goes to Europe. I'd like to increase\nthe amount of trade coming to the United States, and also to improve economic integration\nacross North Africa, which could greatly benefit Morocco because of Morocco's stability and\nMorocco's very strong economic foundation. The greater integration there is, the greater the\nbenefits for Moroccans.\nThird, the attack in Benghazi this week reminds us that security remains a vital issue. Through\nour work together on the Global Counterterrorism Task Force, the United States and Morocco\nalready share crucial information and best practices, and I thank Morocco for hosting a Global\nCounterterrorism Task Force workshop on threats in the South Atlantic next month.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

And so we are\npartnering to help strengthen Morocco's criminal justice system and law enforcement.\nThere will be a lot to discuss in the meeting today. And let me add, the United States greatly\nappreciates the constructive role Morocco is playing on the UN Security Council, especially your\nsupport for the effort to end the violence and bloodshed in Syria and help to usher in a new\ndemocratic future for that country. I commend Morocco for offering to host the next ministerial\nmeeting of the Friends of the Syrian People, and we look forward to continuing to work closely\ntogether as close partners even after your term on the Security Council has ended.\nFinally, our education and cultural ties are reason for much celebration. This year marks the 30th\nanniversary of our official program to facilitate academic exchanges and other bonds between us.\nThere are more than 5,000 Moroccan alumni of these programs. Two are with us today \u2014 Dr.\nBenjelloun and Dr. Ouaouicha \u2014 and we thank them. But among all our work on this front, from\npreserving Morocco's historic sites to empowering youth, there's one area I particularly hope we\ncan focus on today and receive your advice and counsel \u2014 namely, interfaith dialogue.\nIn these tense and turbulent times, it's more important than ever for people of different faiths to\nexchange ideas, to build understanding, to promote religious tolerance. It's one of the great\nchallenges of the 21st century, and it's one that we must address together.\nSo we have a lot of work to do, Minister, but our friendship runs long and deep, and as the treaty\nour nations signed in 1786 says, and I quote, \"Trusting in God, it will remain permanent.\" I'm\nconfident that we will continue to solve problems and produce results that make our nations\nstronger, more peaceful, more secure, more prosperous, and also contribute to doing the same for\nthe world.\nSo again, let me welcome you, Minister. It's been a great pleasure for me to get to know you, to\nwork with you, to be your colleague bilaterally, regionally, and globally, and also welcome your\ndistinguished delegation.\nThank you. (Applause.)\nRemarks at Reception Ntlarking Eid ul-Fitr\nSeptember 13, 2012\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Good evening, and although I am many weeks overdue in saying it:\nEid Mubarak.

And I would like to thank all of you for being\nhere, including the many members of the Diplomatic Corps.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nTonight, our gathering is more somber than any of us would like. This comes during sad and\ndifficult days for the State Department family. We lost four Americans. They were good and\nbrave men. They were committed to the cause of building a brighter future for the people of\nLibya. And we condemn the violence in the strongest terms, the violence against our posts in\nBenghazi, in Egypt, and now in Yemen.\nThe Libyan ambassador is with us tonight, and I want to take a moment to thank him for the\nsupport that his government and the Libyan people have shown to the United States in this\ntragedy, particularly the outpouring of feelings of grief and loss because of the killing of our\nambassador.\nAmbassador Aujali, would you mind saying a few words?\nAMBASSADOR AMU: [redacted]\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Ambassador. I know that that was a very\npersonal loss for you, as it was for me. I'm the one who sent Chris to Benghazi during the\nrevolution to show support and be able to advise our government about what we could do to\nbring freedom and democracy and opportunity to the people of Libya.\nReligious freedom and religious tolerance are essential to the stability of any nation, any people.\nHatred and violence in the name of religion only poison the well. All people of faith and good\nwill know that the actions of a small and savage group in Benghazi do not honor religion or God\nin any way. Nor do they speak for the more than one billion Muslims around the world, many of\nwhom have shown an outpouring of support during this time\nUnfortunately, however, over the last 24 hours, we have also seen violence spread elsewhere.\nSome seek to justify this behavior as a response to inflammatory, despicable material posted on\nthe intemet. As I said earlier today, the United States rejects both the content and the message of\nthat video. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of\nothers. At our meeting earlier today, my colleague, the foreign minister of Morocco, said that all\nprophets should be respected because they are all symbols of our humanity, for all humanity.\nBut both of us were crystal clear in this paramount message: There is never any justification for\nviolent acts of this kind. And we look to leaders around the world to stand up and speak out\nagainst violence, and to take steps to protect diplomatic missions from attack.\nThink about it. When Christians are subject to insults to their faith, and that certainly happens,\nwe expect them not to resort to violence. When Hindus or Buddhists are subjected to insults to\ntheir faiths, and that also certainly happens, we expect them not to resort to violence. The same\ngoes for all faiths, including Islam.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nWhen all of us who are people of faith - and I am one \u2014 feel the pain of insults, of\nmisunderstanding, of denigration to what we cherish, we must expect ourselves and others not to\nresort to violence, That is a universal standard and expectation, and it is everyone's obligation to\nmeet that, so that we make no differences, we expect no less of ourselves than we expect of\nothers, You cannot respond to offensive speech with violence without begetting more violence.\nAnd I so strongly believe that the great religions of the world are stronger than any insults. They\nhave withstood offense for centuries. Refraining from violence, then, is not a sign of weakness in\none's faith; it is absolutely the opposite, a sign that one's faith is unshakable.\nSo tonight, we must come together and recommit ourselves to working toward a future marked\nby understanding and acceptance rather than distrust, hatred, and fear. We can pledge that\nwhenever one person speaks out in ignorance and bigotry, ten voices will answer. They will\nanswer resoundingly against the offense and the insult, answering ignorance with enlightenment,\nanswering hatred with understanding, answering darkness with light; that if one person commits\na violent act in the name of religion, millions will stand up and condemn it out of strength.\nIn times like these, it can be easy to despair that some differences are irreconcilable, some\nmountains too steep to climb; we will therefore never reach the level of understanding and\npeacefulness that we seek, and which I believe the great religions of the world call us to pursue.\nBut that's not what I believe, and I don't think it's what you believe either here tonight. Part of\nwhat makes our country so special is we keep trying. We keep working. We keep investing in\nour future. We keep supporting the next generation, believing that young people can keep us\nmoving forward in a positive direction.\nSo tonight I think it's important that we talk not just about that better tomorrow that we all seek,\nbut also about some of the things \u2014 the real, practical, tangible things \u2014 that young people are\ndoing to help shape that better future.\nTwo years ago in this room, at our Eid reception, we launched a program called Generation\nChange to lead a grassroots agenda of positive engagement with Muslim communities. And I\nasked the young Muslim leaders in the audience that night to be our unofficial ambassadors, to\nhelp build personal connections, seek out partners in other countries. And I can report to you\ntonight they did not disappoint. In a few minutes, you're going to meet some of these young\nleaders, each with a powerful story to tell.\nThe Generation Change network that started in this room now circles the globe. We are building\nan international alliance of young people who want to drive change in their own communities.\nThey act as mentors, spark respectful debates, simply offer words of encouragement when\nneeded. But most importantly, they inspire others to keep expanding the circle of mutual\nunderstanding and respect, one person at a time.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nEven as we work to spread tolerance more broadly, we also are working to deepen our\nappreciation for the experiences of others. Our 2012 Hours Against Hate initiative encourages\nyoung people to put themselves in another person's shoes through service projects. So far, young\npeople from all over the world have pledged thousands of volunteer hours to help people from a\ndifferent background, to see them as a fellow human being, not a stereotype, not a caricature, but\nanother real live person \u2014 people who don't look like you, live like you, pray like you, but with\nwhom we will share this planet. And therefore, we have work to do.\nPeople of faith and conscience are called to be the leaders of tolerance. In my tradition, like all\ntraditions, we are expected to love one another. And together, we have to translate that into better\nunderstanding and cooperation. I'm particularly pleased that the young people you will hear from\ntonight are really setting an example, not only for young people elsewhere in the world but,\nfrankly, for us who are older as well.\nLet me now call to the stage someone who has been a tremendous assistance to me in these\nefforts. Farah Pandith is the Department's first Special Representative to Muslim Communities.\nAnd from the beginning, she has made reaching out to young people and civil society her top\npriority. Farah will introduce you to three young leaders who I am very proud of\nRemarks at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony to Honor Those Lost in Attacks in Benghazi, Libya\nSeptember 14, 2012\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Chaplain. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President,\nSecretary Panetta, Ambassador Rice, Secretary Powell and Mrs. Powell, family members of the\nfour patriots and heroes we bring home, members of the State Department family, ladies and\ngentlemen, today we bring home four Americans who gave their lives for our country and our\nvalues. To the families of our fallen colleagues, I offer our most heartfelt condolences and\ndeepest gratitude.\nSean Smith joined the State Department after six years in the Air Force. He was respected as an\nexpert on technology by colleagues in Pretoria, Baghdad, Montreal, and The Hague. He enrolled\nin correspondence courses at Penn State and had high hopes for the future. Sean leaves behind a\nloving wife Heather, two young children, Samantha and Nathan, and scores of grieving family,\nfriends, and colleagues. And that's just in this world. Because online in the virtual worlds that\nSean helped create, he is also being mourned by countless competitors, collaborators, and garners\nwho shared his passion.\nTyrone Woods, known to most as Rone, spent two decades as a Navy SEAL, serving multiple\ntours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in\ndangerous posts from Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well\nas the arms of a warrior, earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. Our\nhearts go out to Tyrone's wife Dorothy, and his three sons Tyrone, Jr., Hunter, and Kai, born just\na few months ago, along with his grieving faii)ily, friends, and colleagues.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Glen deployed to some of the\nmost dangerous places on Earth, including Iraq and Afghanistan, always putting his life on the\nline to safeguard other Americans. Our thoughts and prayers are with Glen's father Bernard, his\nmother Barbara, his brother Gregory, his sister Kathleen, and their grieving families, friends, and\ncolleagues.\nI was honored to know Ambassador Chris Stevens. I want to thank his parents and siblings, who\nare here today, for sharing Chris with us and with our country. What a wonderful gift you gave\nus. Over his distinguished career in the Foreign Service, Chris won friends for the United States\nin far-flung places. He made those people's hopes his own. During the revolution in Libya, he\nrisked his life to help protect the Libyan people from a tyrant, and he gave his life helping them\nbuild a better country.\nPeople loved to work with Chris. And as he rose through the ranks, they loved to work for Chris.\nHe was known not only for his courage but for his smile \u2014 goofy but contagious \u2014 for his sense\nof fun and that California cool.\nIn the days since the attack, so many Libyans \u2014 including the Ambassador from Libya to the\nUnited States, who is with us today \u2014 have expressed their sorrow and solidarity. One young\nwoman, her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness, held up a handwritten sign that said\n\"Thugs and killers don't represent Benghazi nor Islam,\" The President of the Palestinian\nAuthority, who worked closely with Chris when he served in Jerusalem, sent me a letter\nremembering his energy and integrity, and deploring \u2014 and I quote \u2014 \"an act of ugly terror.\"\nMany others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments.\nThis has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We've seen the\nheavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We've seen rage\nand violence directed at American embassies over an awful interne video that we had nothing to\ndo with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because it is senseless, and it is\ntotally unacceptable.\nThe people of Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the\ntyranny of a mob. Reasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do\neverything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts. And\nwe will, under the President's leadership, keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the\nworld.\nThere will be more difficult days ahead, but it is important that we don't lose sight of the\nfundamental fact that America must keep leading the world. We owe it to those four men to\ncontinue the long, hard work of diplomacy. I am enormously proud of the men and women of the\nState Department. I'm proud of all those across our government, civilian and military alike, who\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

If the last few days teach us anything, let\nit be this: That this work and the men and women who risk their lives to do it are at the heart of\nwhat makes America great and good.\nSo we will wipe away our tears, stiffen our spines, and face the future undaunted. And we will\ndo it together, protecting and helping one another, just like Sean, Tyrone, Glen, and Chris always\ndid. May God bless them and grant their families peace and solace, and may God continue to\nbless the United States of America.\nAnd now, let me have the great honor of introducing someone who came to the State Department\nearlier this week to grieve with us. He well understands and values the work that these men were\ndoing for our country. The President of the United States.\nRemarks With Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Patricia Espinosa After Their\nMeeting\nSeptember 18, 2012\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it is such a pleasure for me to\nwelcome my friend and colleague, Secretary Espinosa, along with a very distinguished\ndelegation of officials from the Mexican Government for this continuation of consultation at the\nhighest levels of each of our governments.\nBefore I turn to the matters discussed today, let me give a brief update on the ongoing U.S.\nresponse to the protests in the Middle East and elsewhere. I'm sure as you know already, we are\ntaking aggressive steps to protect our staffs in embassies and consulates worldwide. That\nincludes reviewing our security posture at every post and augmenting it where necessary. And\nwe are working closely with the Libyan Government in our efforts to bring to justice those who\nmurdered our four American colleagues in Benghazi.\nThe FBI is now in Tripoli to join the investigation with Libyan officials, and there is nothing\nmore important to us than ensuring the safety of our American representatives worldwide. At the\nsame time, as I have said to State Department employees, the incidents of the past week highlight\nhow important our work is. The United States must and will remain strongly engaged in the\nworld. Our men and women risk their lives in service to our country and our values, because they\nknow that the United States must be a force for peace and progress. That is worth striving and\nsacrificing for, and nothing that happened last week changes this fundamental fact.\nNow, turning to our friends and partners in Mexico, we are always pleased to have a chance to\ndiscuss matters of mutual interest and concern between us. Mexico is one of our closest friends\nas well as partner on dozens of critical issues. So we talk about every kind of issue you can\nimagine, from education and healthcare to poverty alleviation to the environment. But today, we\nfocused on a top priority for us both a security.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nWe just co-chaired the fourth meeting of the U.S.-Mexico Merida High-Level Consultative\nGroup. This is the last one we will hold during the Calderon Administration. And I want to offer\nmy personal appreciation to President Calderon and to Foreign Secretary Espinosa for their\nleadership and commitment to this partnership and to all on both sides of the border in our\ngovernments who have been deeply engaged and committed to it. The Merida Initiative\nrepresents an unprecedented level of security cooperation between Mexico and the United States.\nAs our countries continue to deal with the serious challenge of transnational criminal\norganizations, including drug traffickers, illegal arms traffickers, money launderers, and violent\ngangs that threaten people on both sides of the border, we well know there is no quick and easy\nway to stop these criminals and bring them to justice. But nevertheless, during the past now\nnearly four years, our countries have collaborated to an extraordinary and unprecedented degree.\nWe have brought together policy makers and experts from across our governments and societies\nwho have worked hand in hand to keep our people safe. And I think the habits of cooperation we\nhave built are among our most important achievements, and we will rely on them for a long time\nto come.\nToday, our delegations reviewed the gains we've made on key priorities, including improving\nlaw enforcement coordination, reducing the demand for drugs, modernizing our border\ninfrastructure, strengthening the rule of law, and building more resilient and empowered\ncommunities. We also discussed the lessons we've learned and the work that lies ahead in these\nand other areas, which our joint statement will reflect. I want to underscore how important our\nsecurity relationship with Mexico is to the United States.\nThe Government of Mexico and the Mexican people have faced the threat posed by these\ncriminals with courage and resolve, and we remain committed to doing everything we can to\nsupport Mexico as it continues to work to bring those criminals to justice. This is a transnational\nproblem, and it calls for a transnational solution, and the United States believes this is a matter of\nshared responsibility. That was the first message I brought as Secretary of State when I came to\nMexico, and it continues to be the hallmark of our efforts together. Making sure our people are\nsafe and our neighbors are safe is of the utmost importance to us.\nNow, our two countries share many other priorities, and one of them, empowering women and\ngirls, was also addressed today. We took the opportunity, the Foreign Secretary and I, to sign a\nMemorandum of Understanding between our countries to work together to advance gender\nequality, empower girls and women, promote their human rights, and enhance their security.\nSo again, Secretary Espinosa, let me thank you for years of work and effort, for our productive\nconversations in many places around the world and again today, and for being such a valuable\ncolleague and partner. The United States deeply, deeply values our relationship with Mexico and\nthe ties of family and friendship that connect so many millions of our people.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

We believe strongly that presidential administrations may\nchange, elections will come and go, but we have established a firm foundation for cooperation\nthat has already benefited both our countries and which will continue to benefit both of our\ncountries for many years ahead. So thank you very much.\nMS. NULAND: We'll take (inaudible). Margaret Brennan, CBS News.\nQUESTION: Madam Secretary, thanks for your time. Are you any closer to finding who killed\nAmbassador Chris Stevens?, Libya's President says this attack was planned for months. Are you\nconfident he's wrong and that security measures were appropriate? And will you leave justice to\nthe Libyans?\nSECRETARY CLINTON: As I said at the outset, we are taking aggressive steps to protect our\npeople and our consulates and embassies around the world. We are reviewing our security\nposture at every post and working with host governments to be sure they know what our security-\nneeds are wherever necessary. We are also working closely with the Libyan Government to bring\nthe perpetrators to justice so that we can be assured that we have found who murdered our four,\ncolleagues and under what circumstances. As I said, the FBI has joined the investigation inside\nLibya, and we will not rest until the people who orchestrated this attack are found and punished.\nIt is also important to look at this strategically and understand what is going on across the region.\nIn a number of places where protests have tuned violent, we are seeing the hand of extremists\nwho are trying to exploit people's inflamed passions for their own agendas. But overwhelmingly,\nwe have found that the people of Egypt, of Libya, of Yemen and Tunisia are not prepared to\ntrade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob. They want to turn their attention to the\nfuture to provide better opportunities for themselves and their children, and they want a strong\npartnership with the United States and the American people based on mutual interests and mutual\nrespect.\nThis is part of a larger debate that is going on inside these societies. In Libya, for example, in\ntheir first free elections, moderates were successful at the polls. But look, there are extremists in\nall of these societies and on the outside who are working to take advantage of broad outrage in\norder to incite violence and specifically incite violence against Americans and American\nfacilities.\nAnd as I have said to many of the leaders I have spoken to over the past week, these extremist\nefforts are a threat to the people of the societies and the governments of those societies as well as\nto the region and the United States. And I think it's important at this moment for leaders to put\nthemselves on the right side of this debate - to speak out clearly and unequivocally against\nviolence, whoever incites it or conducts it\nAnd in a struggle like this, there can be no doubt where the United States must stand. We support\nthose who are fighting for the same values and rights that we believe in - in democracy, in\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

And I want to\nunderscore that the United States will continue to work with partners and allies in the region and\naround the world to help bring security to these nations so that the promise of the revolutions that\nthey experienced can be realized.\nAnd finally, on your specific point about Benghazi, we obviously never talk publicly about\nsecurity at any of our missions for obvious reasons. But that said, let me assure you that our\nsecurity in Benghazi included a unit of host government security forces, as well as a local guard\nforce of the kind that we rely on in many places around the world. In addition to the security\noutside the compound, we relied on a wall and a robust security presence inside the compound.\nAnd with all of our missions overseas, in advance of September lid', as is done every year, we\ndid an evaluation on threat streams. And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has\nsaid we had no actionable intelligence that an attack on our post in Benghazi was planned or\nimminent.\nBut let me state the obvious again. Our diplomats engage in dangerous work, and it's the nature\nof diplomacy in fragile societies and conflict zones to be aware of the necessity for security but\nto also continue the important diplomatic work that has to go on. There is risk inherent in what\nwe do and what these brave men and women representing the United States are up against every\nsingle day, and we do our very best to limit that risk by ensuring that our security protocols\nreflect the environments in which diplomats work and the threats that they are presented with.\nThank you.\nRemarks With Indonesian Foreign Minister Raden Mohammad Marty Muliana\nNatalegawa After Their Meeting\nSeptember 20, 2012\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it's such a pleasure, as always, to\nwelcome the Indonesian Foreign Minister, and I believe the largest delegation that has ever come\nfrom Indonesia, for the purpose of our third meeting of the U.S.-Indonesia Joint Commission.\nThis commission is the result of a vision by our two presidents for a comprehensive partnership,\nand the agreement to that effect was signed in 2010. Thanks to this partnership, the United States\nand Indonesia are working more closely than ever on a range of issues from global security to\nclean energy and climate to regional trade and commerce.\nAnd today, Marty and I had the chance to take stock of where our teams have come in the time\nof the last year, because we liad our meeting in Bali a year ago. And I must say, I was very\nimpressed. We covered a great deal today.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nBut before I start, I'd like to say a few words about the protests in several countries around the\nworld. We have condemned in the strongest possible terms the violence that has erupted from\nthese protests. And as I have said, the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and\nreprehensible, and the United States Government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it.\nBut there is no justification for violence, and I want to thank the Foreign Minister and his\ngovernment for speaking out against violence. We have to look to reasonable people and\nresponsible leaders everywhere to stand up to extremists who would seek to take advantage of\nthis moment to commit violent acts against embassies and their fellow countrymen.\nToday's meetings have highlighted the strong foundation that we have built together. And one of\nour most important concerns is promoting peace and stability in the Asia Pacific. Today, I'm\nannouncing that the Obama Administration has informed Congress of the potential sale of eight\nAH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters to the Indonesian Government. This agreement will\nstrengthen our comprehensive partnership and help enhance security across the region.\nOn growth and prosperity, we are increasing our trade relationship that topped $26 billion last\nyear. Investments in transportation, energy, and infrastructure are creating jobs and supporting\neconomic growth in both countries. For example, the deal between Lion Air and Boeing alone\nrepresents $21 billion in trade over the next decade. Indonesia's Government has announced half\na trillion dollars in infrastructure improvements, and we recently signed a memorandum of\nunderstanding to make it easier for American companies to bid on these projects.\nAnd yesterday, we signed an agreement for implementing our Millennium Challenge\nCorporation Compact with Indonesia. Over the next five years, the United States will invest $600\nmillion in clean energy development, child health and nutrition programs, and efforts to help\nmake Indonesia's Government more transparent and open.\nThe United States is also looking forward to Indonesia hosting APEC in 2013, and we are\nconfident that Indonesia will come to this role with a commitment to promote greater economic\nintegration across the Asia Pacific.\nBoth the Foreign Minister and I believe that strong education is essential to compete in a modem\nglobal economy. That's why the United States has expanded the Fulbright Program and\nsupported partnerships between dozens of American and Indonesian universities. Academic\nexchanges between our countries are up and applications from Indonesian students to visit the\nUnited States have increased by one third. USAID has recently expanded its basic education\nprogram to provide $83 million for teacher training and literacy programs for young children.\nAnd we're providing $20 in scholarship funding for Indonesian graduate students.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

The Foreign Minister's\npersonal leadership has helped lay the groundwork for diplomacy between ASEAN and China as\nit relates to the South China Sea. And we continue to support ASEAN's six-point principles,\nwhich we believe will help reduce tensions and pave the way for a comprehensive code of\nconduct for addressing disputes without threats, coercion, or use of force.\nFinally. Indonesia and the United States have stood together on a range of global challenges,\nfrom democratic reform in Burma to combating climate change, to working to end the violence\nin Syria. We are also coordinating efforts to further develop south-south and triangular\ncooperation, such as enhancing disaster preparedness in Burma and convening a conference on\nwomen's empowerment.\nWe believe that as the second and third-largest democracies in the world, the United States and\nIndonesia have a special responsibility to promote democracy and human rights. And for the last\nfour years, Indonesia has hosted the Bali Democracy Forum to promote peaceful, democratic\ntransitions through example and open dialogue. Last year, more than 80 countries attended. And\nonce again, the United States will be sending a high-level delegation.\nSo, Minister, thank you for everything. Thank you for the great partnership we've had between\nus and between our countries.\nMS. NULAND: We'll take two questions today, we'll start with Ros Jordan of Al Jazeera\nEnglish.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Madam Secretary, Mr. Foreign Minister. Madam Secretary, my\nquestion is about the ongoing investigation into last week's attack at the consulate in Benghazi.\nYou are meeting this afternoon with members of Congress to discuss the progress and the\nconcerns that they understandably have. First, there is the federal mandate to establish an\naccountability review board. Have you done so? Who would you like to see chair it? Are there\ncertain questions that you desperately want to have answered in order to safeguard the safety of\nForeign Service Officers around the world?\nAnd related to this, given the political instability and the successes of the past year and a half, are\nyou satisfied that in light of those political changes, enough was done to protect those working in\nthe Middle East and North Africa? And then finally \u2014 and this is perhaps going into the area of\nrumor and speculation \u2014 but there is at least one report suggesting that Ambassador Stevens felt\nthat he was on a, quote, \"al-Qaida hit list\" Is this a scurrilous rumor? Is this gallows humor\nwhen one is working in a period of difficulty and great challenge, or is there something more to\nwhat he allegedly \u2014 and I stress that word \u2014 said?\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Well, first, let me say I'm looking forward to the opportunity to go\nup to the Congress today. I will be briefing in two separate sessions, the House and the Senate, in\na classified setting, along with my interagency colleagues, as we continue to work together, and\nwith governments around the world, to ensure that our people and our facilities are safe. I will be\njoined today by the Director of National Intelligence, General Clapper, by the Deputy Secretary\nof Defense, Ash Carter, by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Sandy Winnefeld,\nalong with experts from the FBI, the State Department, and elsewhere in the government.\nNow, I anticipate that this briefing will cover our security posture before and during the events,\nand the steps we have taken since to do everything we can with host governments to protect our\npeople and our embassies and consulates. The Director of National Intelligence will speak to the\nintelligence issues surrounding these events in Libya. Deputy Secretary Carter will brief on the\nsuperb support we have had from the U.S. military in the wake of these events, and we are at the\nvery early stages of an FBI investigation. The team from the FBI reached Libya earlier this week.\nAnd I will advise Congress also that I am launching an accountability review board that will be\nchaired by Ambassador Thomas Pickering.\nI will also talk about the importance of the broader relationships with these countries in light of\nthe events of the past days. There are obviously very real challenges in these new democracies,\nthese fragile societies, but as I said last week, the vast majority of the people in these countries\ndid not throw off the tyranny of a dictator to trade it for the tyranny of a mob. And we are\nconcerned first and foremost with our own people and facilities, but we are concerned about the\ninternal security in these countries because ultimately, that puts at risk the men, women, and\nchildren of these societies on a daily ongoing basis if actions are not taken to try to restore\nsecurity and civil order.\nAnd let me just conclude by saying that there can be no doubt where the United States stands.\nWe continue to support those who are fighting for universal values \u2014 values that we see at work\nin Indonesia \u2014 the third largest democracy in the world. We believe that these values of universal\nrights, of justice and accountability, of democracy, are there for every person regardless of where\nthat person might live. So I will look forward to having a chance to talk with members of\nCongress.\nAs to your final question, I have absolutely no information or reason to believe that there's any\nbasis for that.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMS. NULAND: Last question. Victoria Sidjabat from Tempo Magazine, please.\nQUESTION: Yes. Madam, thank you. My question is: Starting today, U.S. Embassy and\nConsulate are closed in Indonesia as the Muslim movie become wild fireball, which could be\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

If it's continuing happen, it's \u2014\nobviously could give impact to the implementation of (inaudible) program in Indonesia. What is\nthe reason U.S. Government closed the Embassy and Consulate in Indonesia? What is your\nexpectation from Indonesia Government, for my Minister Marty Natalegawa? How Indonesia\nGovernment respond to the closing of this Embassy and Consulate, it's starting today? Is U.S. \u2014\nIndonesia Government has capability to protect U.S. Embassy and Consulate. So the (inaudible)\nprogram implemented \u2014 could be implemented successfully in Indonesia. Thank you.\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Well, let me begin by saying how grateful we are for the excellent\ncooperation we have received from the Government of Indonesia, and in particular, from the law\nenforcement and security institutions in Indonesia. We are very grateful for not only the\ncooperation and protection that has been provided to our facilities, but also to the strong\nstatements condemning violence from the President, the Foreign Mihister, and others.\nIn consultation with the Government of Indonesia, we have temporarily, for tomorrow, closed\nour facilities. We want to be sure that law enforcement in Indonesia has the ability to do what it\nneeds to do to make sure that there is no disruption of civil order and security. So we are\ncooperating completely, and we're very grateful for the strong leadership provided by Indonesia.\nFOREIGN MINISTER NATALEGAWA: Hello, (inaudible), if I may just also respond.\nPrecisely as the Secretary had said, the decision by the United States Government to close\ntemporarily its embassies and consulates tomorrow in Indonesia is a decision that's been made\nbased on communication and conversation between the authorities in Indonesia and the United\nStates as well. So in other words, it is an informed decision, a decision that is not intended to\nshow any unfriendly intent on the part of anyone, but it is what it is, and it's quite some \u2014 it's the\nkind of step that governments actually carry out when situations requires it, even in our case.\nSome of our embassies abroad, when the situation requires us to have a temporary closing of the\nembassy, we do that as well. So it is something that is quite regular and something that is\nactually coordinated as well.\nBut if I may just broaden the subject matter, I think as our President had said in the past,\nIndonesian Government the Indonesian people, even, obviously cannot and would not condone\nthe \u2014 any acts of violence against diplomatic premises, against diplomatic personnel, because\nthat is, truly \u2014 would be a challenge to the efficient and a proper conduct of relations among\nstates. So that's our point of departure.\nAt the same time, of course, beyond the immediate issue of protection of the embassies, we have\nstill ahead of us the challenge of how to prevent the kind of situations where we are now at in\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

We've had the opportunity to meet in Islamabad and other\nsettings, but I am very pleased that we would have this chance to exchange views on our bilateral\nrelationship as well as regional and global issues.\nI want to begin by addressing the events of the day and the past week. Today, we've once again\nseen protests in several cities in Pakistan. Unfortunately, some of those protests have turned\nviolent and, sadly, resulted in loss of life. I want to thank the Government of Pakistan for their\nefforts to protect our Embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Lahore, Peshawar, and Karachi.\nAnd I want to be clear, as I have said on numerous occasions, the violence we have seen cannot\nbe tolerated. There is no justification for violence. Of course, there is provocation, and we have\ncertainly made clear that we do not in any way support provocation. We found the video that's at\nthe core of this series of events offensive, disgusting, reprehensible.\nBut that does not provide justification for violence, and therefore it is important for responsible\nleaders, indeed responsible people everywhere, to stand up and speak out against violence and\nparticularly against those who would exploit this difficult moment to advance their own\nextremist ideologies.\nYesterday afternoon when I briefed the Congress, I made it clear that keeping our people\neverywhere in the world safe is our top priority. What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist\nattack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who\nmurdered four Americans. And we are taking aggressive measures at all of our posts to protect\nour staffs and their families along with locally employed people who provide so many important\ncontributions to the work of our missions.\nThe Foreign Minister and I will have a chance to cover a full range of subjects today, and it is no\nsecret that the past year and a half has been challenging for Pakistan and the United States. And\nwe still have work to do to get our bilateral relationship to the point where we would like it to be,\nbut we both recognize that we can achieve more when we work together on a focused agenda.

I look forward to seeing President Zardari next week\nat the UN General Assembly. At each meeting, we are working to identify the strategic goals we\nshare \u2014 and there are many \u2014 and the concrete actions we can each take to accomplish them.\nOur number one shared priority remains pursuing our joint counterterrorism objectives to ensure\nthe security of American and Pakistani citizens alike. We face a common threat from a common\nenemy, and we must confront terrorism and extremism together. Earlier this month, I designated\nthe Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization so we could make full use of every\navailable legal authority to end their deadly attacks. Pakistan's parliament has called for\nexpelling foreign fighters so that Pakistan's territory can be fully under control of the Pakistani\nGovernment and cannot be used to launch attacks against other nations.\nAnd the follow-through on this is challenging but necessary, and we look forward to working\nwith Pakistan as they continue to address these problems. We have both pledged to support a\nsecure, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan, which is vital for the security of the region. And I\nwant to thank Foreign Minister Khar for Pakistan's reopening of the NATO supply lines to allow\nthe movement of goods to Afghanistan.\nWe will discuss the successful first meeting of the Safe Passage Working Group in Islamabad\nwhich brought together Afghan, Pakistani, and U.S. representatives to advance the peace process\nin Afghanistan. The Pakistani Government's public call for insurgents to come forward and talk\nwith the Afghan Government was particularly important. We are ready to work together to build\non these steps, and we will continue our discussions through bilateral consultations and the U.S.-\nAfghanistan-Pakistan Core Group.\nNow, of course, our relationship goes far beyond our shared security concerns, and today we will\ndiscuss the many other ways in which we work together, particularly to create economic\nopportunity for Pakistanis. Foreign Minister Khar and I agree that we need to shift our economic\nrelationship from aid to trade and investment. We are working to help Pakistan attract more\nprivate sector investment. We hope to finalize a bilateral investment treaty soon. And we've\ncreated a Pakistan private investment initiative to help more of Pakistan's small and medium\nsized companies get access to capital.\nOver the past few years, we have seen Pakistan's civilian government begin to put down stronger\nroots. And if elections proceed as planned next year, it will mark the first time in Pakistan's\nhistory that a civilian-led government has served its full term. The United States supports\nPakistan's economic development, and we have said many times that we want to see democracy\nsucceed in Pakistan.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

I am pleased to welcome the Foreign Minister from\nTunisia I'm looking forward to our meeting, We obviously have a great deal to discuss, and I\nwant to thank the Foreign Minister and the Government of Tunisia for their efforts over the last\nweek to help secure our Embassy and the American Cooperative School of Tunis following the\nviolent assaults of last Friday.\nWe are monitoring events closely today. There is no higher priority for President Obama and\nmyself than the safety of our people. We've taken a number of steps around the world to\naugment security and to protect our personnel at diplomatic posts. And we are working closely\nwith host governments in this effort.\nAs I have said before and as is embodied in the Vienna Convention and other international\nagreements, all governments have the duty, the solemn duty, to defend diplomatic missions.\nThey must be safe and protected places so that governments can exchange views and work on\nmany important issues, and leaders across the world must stand up and be counted in rejecting\nviolence and holding violent actors accountable.\nWe are working closely with the Government of Tunisia They have assisted us in enhancing the\nsecurity of our facilities. We've also discussed with them the imperative of bringing to justice\nthose responsible for these violent attacks. And we have offered and will continue to look for\nways that we can assist the new Government of Tunisia in ensuring the rule of law throughout\ntheir country, first and foremost for the people of Tunisia themselves. We look forward to\ncontinuing to build our hew partnership with the Tunisian Government and people. Our\nrelationship is built around the shared principles of all democracies \u2014 a commitment to\nnonviolence, to tolerance, and inclusivity for all people, and to upholding the rule of law.\nThe Tunisian people have bravely put themselves on the road to democracy. They were the first\nof the Arab revolutions and they have made important progress in a very short period of time.\nThey have worked too hard and sacrificed too much over too many years to see their progress\nhijacked at derailed by extremists with Ulric own a5,-.\n,\n,encia.

In exchange, she said, African leaders must deliver democracy and good government.\nMrs. Clinton vowed to stay on top of Africa, even after she gets back to Washington, closely monitoring the issues she\naddressed on her tour. She also pointed to Cape Verde, a set of palm-studded islands best known for their beaches and\nenormous tourist hotels, as an example of what good leadership can do.\n\"This is possible,\" she said. \"You create not just economic growth but a sense of human dignity and possibility.\"\nKenya. South Africa. Angola. Congo. Nigeria. Liberia. And finally Cape Verde. Mrs. Clinton saw with her own eyes some of\nAfrica's most promising countries - and some of its most troubled ones. In Kenya, she pushed for the government to\nprosecute perpetrators of the postelection violence last year. In South Africa, the big issue was Zimbabwe and how the\nSouth African government should do more to help ease the crisis there.\nIn Angola, the theme was good governing practices and oil, a strategic concern of the United States given the many\ninroads China has made there and elsewhere in Africa in its hunger for natural resources. In Congo, Mrs. Clinton was\npassionate about the need to end the nation's rape epidemic.\n\"The secretary's visit to the heart of the world's deadliest war zone in eastern Congo was a potential game-changer for\nthat conflict,\" said John Prendergast, a founder of the Washington-based Enough project. \"Her commitment to\naddressing root causes such as the conflict minerals that power our electronics industry was a refreshing contrast to the\nusual disaster sympathy tourism of visiting dignitaries.\"\n\"Now,\" he added, \"comes the hard part: making good on the promises and living up to the high expectations\nengendered by her visit.\"\nIn Nigeria, Mrs. Clinton pressed for electoral changes. In Liberia, she praised the country's president, Ellen Johnson\nSirleaf, the only woman in Africa to be elected head of state.\nThe Liberian visit had a special warmth, almost like a meeting of long-lost cousins. Liberia was founded in the 19th\ncentury by freed American slaves, and the country's flag, the people's names and even the police uniforms with plastic-\nbrimmed hats were all reminiscent of the American versions. Mrs. Clinton received possibly her most exuberant\nwelcome there, and a Liberian man with a long wooden horn followed her around most of the visit, blowing out loud\nfunny noises whenever she said something striking.\n\"I love that - the horn - I want to take that guy with me wherever I go,\" she said.\nIn Cape Verde, Mrs. Clinton seemed to have few bones to pick. For once, she said, she had a cheat sheet on a country\nthat included a list of far more positives than negatives. The country has fewer than 500,000 people and has escaped the\nturmoil that has engulfed so much of Africa.

It portrays his followers as\ndupes.\nUnfortunately, the events of recent days have done nothing to jar the alleged producer out of this default setting.\nWhen questioned about his film in the aftermath of the Libyan and Egyptian attacks, a man identifying himself\nas \"Sam Bacile\" reportedly told the Wall Street Journal that \"Islam is a cancer.\"\nYou don't need a Kenyon college degree to see how this vicious cycle of provocation and violence is fueled,\nand you don't need to be a moral relativist to see that it takes two sides to keep it running.\nI am an American who is justly proud of the First Amendment and its protections of freedom of speech and\nreligion.

And in the tragic events of recent\ndays, those who produced and distributed this hateful movie stand on the same side of this line as the killers of\ninnocents in Libya and Egypt.\nBoth groups are possessed by the unholy spirit of \"blind certainty,\" unacquainted with both the complexity and\ncontradictions of life on Earth and the \"cloud of unknowing\" that hovers over every major religion.\nThe great religious thinkers in Judaism, Christianity and Islam always knew enough to know that they did not\nknow everything.\nThey knew the difference between the eternal decrees of the God of Abraham and the all-too-flawed thoughts of\nordinary people. They knew, in short, that they are not God, who alone is charged with creating and destroying\nthe world and discriminating along the way between the real and the illusory.\nThe killers in Libya have forgotten that.

March 16, 2010 17:13 pm\nJERUSALEM\u2014Suddenly, my city feels again like a war zone..Since the suicide bombings ended in 2005, life in\nJerusalem has been for the most part relatively calm. The worst disruptions have been the traffic jams resulting from\nconstruction of a light rail. jUst like in a normal city. But navy, again, there are clusters of helmeted border nOtiCe near the\ngates of the Old City. black smoke from burning tires in the Arab village across from my porch, young men marching with\ngreen Islamist flags toward my neighborhood, ambulances parked at strategic places ready for this city's ultimate\nnightmare.\nThe return of menace to Jerusalem is not because a mid-level bureaucrat announced stage four of a seven-stage process\nin the eventual construction oft,600 apartments in Ramat Shiomo. a Jewish neighborhood in northeast Jerusalem. Such\nannouncements and building projects have become so routine over the years that Paestinians have scarcely responded,\nlet alone violently. In negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis, the permanence of Ramat Shiomo, and other Jewish\nneighborhoods in East Jerusalem, has been a given. Ramat Shlomo, located between the Jewish neighborhoods of\nFrench Hill and Rarrot, will remain within the boundaries of Israeli Jerusalem accord ng to every peace plan. Unlike the\nSnail Jewish enclaves inserted into Arab neighbochoocis, on which Israelis are strongly buliding in the established\nJewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem defines the national consensus.\nWhy, then, the outbreak of violence now? Why Harness \"day of rage\" over Jerusalem and the Palestinian Authority's call\nto gather on the Temple Mount to \"save\" the Dome of the Rock from non-existent plans to build the Third Temple? Why\nthe sudden outrage over rebuilding a synagogue, destroyed by the Jordanians in 1948, in the Old City's Jewish Quarter,\nwhen dozens of synagogues and yeshivas have been built in the quarter without incident?\nThe answer lies not in Jerusalem but in Washington. By placing the issue of building in Jewish neighborhoods in East\nJerusalem at the center of the peace process, President Obama has inadvertently challenged the Palestinians to do no\nless.\nAstonishingly. Obama is repeating the key tactical mistake of his failed efforts to restart Middle East peace talks over the\nlast year. Though Oben-la's insistence on a settlement freeze to help restart negotiations was legitimate, he went a step\ntoo far by including building in East Jerusalem. Every Israeli government over the last four decades has built in the Jewish\nneighborhoods of East Jerusalem; no government, let alone one headed by the Likud, could possibly agree to a freeze\nthere. Obama made resumption of negotiations hostage to a demand that could not be met. The result was that\nPalestinian leaders were forced to adjust their demands accordingly.\nObama is directly responsible for one of the most absurd turns in the history of Middle East negotiations. Though\nPalestinian leaders negotiated with Israeli governments that built extensively in the West Bank, they now refused to sit\ndown with the first Israeli government to actually agree to a suspension of building. Obama's demand for a building freeze\nin Jerusalem led to a freeze in negotiations.\nFinally, after intensive efforts, the administration produced the pathetic achievement of \"proximity talks\"\u2014setting\nPalestinian-Israeli negotiations back a generation, to the time when Palestinian leaders refused to sit at the same table\nwith Israelis.\nThat Obama could be guilty of such amateurishness was perhaps forgivable because he was, after ail, an amateur. But\nhe has now taken his failed policy and intensified it. By demanding that Israel stop building in Ramat Shlomo and\nelsewhere in East Jerusalem\u2014and placing that demand at the center of American-Israeli relations\u2014he's ensured that the\nPalestinians won't show up even to proximity talks. This is no longer amateurishness; it is pique disguised as policy.\nInitially, when the announcement about building in Ramat Shlomo was made, Israelis shared Vice President Biden's\nhumiliation and were outraged at their government's incompetence. The widespread sense here was that Netanyahu\ndeserved the administration's condemnation, not because of what he did but because of what he didn't do: He failed to\nconvey to all parts of his government the need for caution during Biden's visit, symptomatic of his chaotic style of\ngoverning generally.\nBut not even the opposition accused Netanyahu of a deliberate provocation. These are not the days of Yitzhak Shamir,\nthe former Israeli prime minister who used to greet a visit from Secretary of State James Baker with an announcement of\nthe creation of another West Bank settlement. Netanyahu has placed the need for strategic cooperation with the U.S. on\nthe Iranian threat ahead of the right-wing political agenda. That's why he included the Labor Party into his coalition, and\nwhy he accepted a two-state solution\u2014an historic achievement that set the Likud, however reluctantly, within the\nmainstream consensus supporting Palestinian statehood. The last thing Netanyahu wanted was to embarrass Biden\nduring his goodwill visit and trigger a clash with Obama over an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood.\nNor is it likely that there was a deliberate provocation from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, which runs the interior ministry\nthat oversees building procedures. Shas, which supports peace talks and territorial compromise, is not a nationalist party.\nIts interest is providing housing for its constituents, like the future residents of Ramat Shlomo; provoking international\nincidents is not its style.\nFinally, the very ordinariness of the building procedure\u2014the fact that construction in Jewish East Jerusalem is considered\nby Israelis routine\u2014is perhaps the best proof that there was no intentional ambush of Biden. Apparently no one in the\ninterior ministry could imagine that a long-term plan over Ramat Shiomo would sabotage a state visit.\nIn turning an incident into a crisis, Obama has convinced many Israelis that he was merely seeking, a pretext to pick a fight\nwith Israel. Netanyahu was inadvertently shabby; Obama, deliberately so.\nAc.t,cording to a banner headline in the newspaper Ma'ariv, senior Likud officials believe that Obama's goal is to topple the\nNetanyahu government, by encouraging those in the Labor Party who want to quit the coalition.\nThe popular assumption is that Obama is seeking to prove his resolve as a leader by getting tough with Israel. Given his\nineffectiveness against Iran and his tendency to violate his own self-imposed deadlines for sanctions, the Israeli public is\nnot likely to be impressed. Indeed, Israelis' initial anger at Netanyahu has turned to anger against Obama. According to an\nIsrael Radio poll on March 16, 62 percent of Israelis blame the Obama administration for the crisis, while 20 percent\nblame Netanyahu. (Another 17 percent blame Shas leader Eli Yishai.) \u2022\nIn the last year, the administration has not once publicly condemned the Palestinians for lack of good faith\u2014even though\nthe Palestinian Authority media has, for example, been waging a months-long campaign denying the Jews' historic roots\nin Jerusalem. Just after Biden left Ramailah, Palestinian officials held a ceremony naming a square in the city after a\nterrorist responsible for the massacre of 38 Israeli civilians. That too didn't merit an administration rebuke.\nObama's one-sided public pressure against Israel could intensify the atmosphere of \"open season\" against Israel\ninternationally. Indeed, the European Union has reaffirmed it is linking improved economic relations with Israel to the\nresumption of the peace process\u2014as if it's Israel rather than the Palestinians that has refused to come to the table.\nIf the administration's main tactical error in Middle East negotiating was emphasizing building in Jerusalem, its main\nstrategic error was assuming that a two-state solution was within easy reach. Shortly after Obama took office, Rehm\nEmanuel vvas quoted in the Israeli press insisting that a Palestinian state would be created within Obama's first tent.\ninstead, a year later, we are in the era of suspended proximity talks. Now the administration is demanding that Israel\nnegotiate over final status issues in proximity talks as a way of convincing the Palestinians to agree to those talks--as if\nIsraelis would agree to discuss the future of Jerusalem when Palestinian leaders refuse to even sit with them.\nTo insist on the imminent possibility of a two-state solution requires amnesia. Biden's plea to Israelis to consider a\nwithdrawal to an approximation of the 1967 borders in exchange for peace ignored the fact that Israel made that offer\ntwice in the last decade: first, when Prime Minister Ehud Barak accepted the Clinton Proposals of December 2000, and\nthen more recently when Prime Minister Ehud Olmert renewed the offer to Mahrnoud Abbas. Abbas, says Olmert, never\nreplied.\nThe reason for Palestinian rejection of a two-state solution is because a deal would require Palestinians to confine the\nreturn of the descendants of the 1948 refugees to Palestine rather than to Israel. That would prevent a two-state solution\nfrom devolving into a bi-national, one-state solution. Israel's insistence on survival remains the obstacle to peace.\nTo achieve eventual peace, the international community needs to pressure Palestinian leaders to forgo their claim to Haifa\nand Jaffa and confine their people's right of return to a future Palestinian state--just as the Jews will need to forgo their\nclaim to Hebron and Bethlehem and confine their people's right of return to the state of Israel. That is the only possible\ndeal: conceding my right of return to Greater Israel in exchange for your right of return to Greater Palestine. A majority of\nIsraelis\u2014along with the political system\u2014has accepted that principle. On the Palestinian side, the political system has\nrejected it.\nIn the absence of Palestinian willingness to compromise on the right of return, negotiations should not focus on a two-\nstate solution but on more limited goals.\nThere have been positive signs of change on the Palestinian side in the last few years. The rise of Hamas has created\npanic within Fatah, and the result is, for the first time, genuine security cooperation with Israel. Also, the emergence of\nSalem Fayyad as Palestinian prime minister marks a shift from ideological to pragmatic leadership (though Fayyad still\nlacks a power base). Finally, the West Bank economy is growing, thanks in part to Israel's removal of dozens of\nroadblocks. The goal of negotiations at this point in the conflict should be to encourage those trends.\nBut by focusing on building in Jerusalem, Obama has undermined that possibility too. To the fictitious notion of a peace\nprocess, Obama has now added the fiction of an intransigent Israel blocking the peace process.\nThe administration, according to a report in the Israeli ne\\Aispaper Yedito Aharonot, is making an even more insidious\naccusation against Israel. During his visit, wrote Yediot Aharanot, Bicien told Israeli leaders that their policies are\nendangering American lives in Afghanistan and Iraq. The report has been denied in the White House. Whether or not the\nremark was made, what is clear today in Jerusalem is that Obama's recklessness is endangering Israeli--and Palestinian--\nlives.

Stanley McChrystal. It's a Thursday night in mid-April,\nand the commander of all U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan is sitting in a four-star suite at the HOtel Westminster in\nParis. He's in France to sell his new war strategy to our NATO allies \u2014 to keep up the fiction, in essence, that we actually\nhave allies. Since McChrystal took over a year ago, the Afghan war has become the exclusive property of the United\nStates. Opposition to the war has already toppled the Dutch government, forced the resignation of Germany's president\nand sparked both Canada and the Netherlands to announce the withdrawal of their 4,500 troops. McChrystal is in Paris to\nkeep the French, who have lost more than 40 soldiers in Afghanistan, from going all wobbly on him.\n\"The dinner comes with the position, sir,\" says his chief of staff, Col. Charlie Flynn.\nMcChrystal turns sharply in his chair.\n\"Hey, Charlie,\" he asks, \"does this come with the position?\"\nMcChrystal gives him the middle finger.\nThe general stands and looks around the suite that his traveling staff of 10 has converted into a full-scale operations\ncenter. The tables are crowded with silver Panasonic Toughbooks, and blue cables crisscross the hotel's thick carpet,\nhooked up to satellite dishes to provide encrypted phone and e-mail communications. Dressed in off-the-rack civilian\ncasual \u2014 blue tie, button-down shirt, dress slacks \u2014 McChrystal is way out of his comfort zone. Paris, as one of his\nadvisers says, is the \"most anti-McChrystal city you can imagine.\" The general hates fancy restaurants, rejecting any\nplace with candles on the tables as too \"Gucci.\" He prefers Bud Light Lime (his favorite beer) to Bordeaux, Talladega\nNights (his favorite movie) to Jean-Luc Godard. Besides, the public eye has never been a place where McChrystal felt\ncomfortable: Before President Obama put him in charge of the war in Afghanistan, he spent five years running the\nPentagon's most secretive black ops.\n\"What's the update on the Kandahar bombing?\" McChrystal asks Flynn. The city has been rocked by two massive car\nbombs in the past day alone, calling into question the general's assurances that he can wrest it from the Taliban.\n\"We have two KIAs, but that hasn't been confirmed,\" Flynn says.\nMcChrystal takes a final look around the suite. At 55, he is gaunt and lean, not unlike an older version of Christian Bale in\nRescue Dawn. His slate-blue eyes have the unsettling ability to drill down when they lock on you. If you've fucked up or\ndisappointed him, they can destroy your soul without the need for him to raise his voice.\n\"I'd rather have my ass kicked by a roomful of people than go out to this dinner,\" McChrystal says.\nHe pauses a beat.\n\"Unfortunately,\" he adds, \"no one in this room could do it.\"\nWith that, he's out the door.\n\"Who's he going to dinner with?\" I ask one of his aides.\n\"Some French minister,\" the aide tells me. \"It's fucking gay.\"\nThe next morning, McChrystal and his team gather to prepare for a speech he is giving at the Ecole Militaire, a French\nmilitary academy. The general prides himself on being sharper and ballsier than anyone else, but his brashness comes\nwith a price: Although McChrystal has been in charge of the war for only a year, in that short time he has managed to piss\noff almost everyone with a stake in the conflict. Last fall, during the question-and-answer session following a speech he\ngave in London, McChrystal dismissed the counterterrorism strategy being advocated by Vice President Joe Biden as\n\"shortsighted,\" saying it would lead to a state of \"Chaos-istan.\" The remarks earned him a smackdown from the president\nhimself, who summoned the general to a terse private meeting aboard Air Force One. The message to McChrystal\nseemed clear: Shut the fuck up, and keep a lower profile\nNow, flipping through printout cards of his speech in Paris, McChrystal wonders aloud what Biden question he might get\ntoday, and how he should respond. \"I never know what's going to pop out until I'm up there, that's the problem,\" he says.\nThen, unable to help themselves, he and his staff imagine the general dismissing the vice president with a good one-\nliner.\n\"Are you asking about Vice President Biden?\" McChrystal says with a laugh. \"Who's that?\"\n\"Biden?\" suggests a top adviser. \"Did you say: Bite Me?\"\nWhen Barack Obama entered the Oval Office, he immediately set out to deliver on his most important campaign\npromise on foreign policy: to refocus the war in Afghanistan on what led us to invade in the first place. \"I want the\nAmerican people to understand,\" he announced in March 2009. \"We have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle\nand defeat Al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan.\" He ordered another 21,000 troops to Kabul, the largest increase since\nthe war began in 2001. Taking the advice of both the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he also fired Gen. David\nMcKiernan \u2014 then the U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan \u2014 and replaced him with a man he didn't know and had\nmet only briefly: Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It was the first time a top general had been relieved from duty during wartime in\nmore than 50 years, since Harry Truman fired Gen. Douglas MacArthur at the height of the Korean War.\nEven though he had voted for Obama, McChrystal and his new commander in chief failed from the outset to connect. The\ngeneral first encountered Obama a week after he took office, when the president met with a dozen senior military officials\nin a room at the Pentagon known as the Tank. According to sources familiar with the meeting, McChrystal thought Obama\nlooked \"uncomfortable and intimidated\" by the roomful of military brass. Their first one-on-one meeting took place in the\nOval Office four months later, after McChrystal got the Afghanistan job, and it didn't go much better. \"It was a 10-minute\nphoto op,\" says an adviser to McChrystal. \"Obama clearly didn't know anything about him, who he was. Here's the guy\nwho's going to run his fucking war, but he didn't seem very engaged. The Boss was pretty disappointed.\"\nFrom the start, McChrystal was determined to place his personal stamp on Afghanistan, to use it as a laboratory for a\ncontroversial military strategy known as counterinsurgency. COIN, as the theory is known, is the new gospel of the\nPentagon brass, a doctrine that attempts to square the military's preference for high-tech violence with the demands of\nfighting protracted wars in failed states. COIN calls for sending huge numbers of ground troops to not only destroy the\nenemy, but to live among the civilian population and slowly rebuild, or build from scratch, another nation's government \u2014 a\nprocess that even its staunchest advocates admit requires years, if not decades, to achieve. The theory essentially\nrebrands the military, expanding its authority (and its funding) to encompass the diplomatic and political sides of warfare:\nThink the Green Berets as an armed Peace Corps. In 2006, after Gen. David Petraeus beta-tested the theory during his\n\"surge\" in Iraq, it quickly gained a hardcore following of think-tankers, journalists, military officers and civilian officials.\nNicknamed \"COINdinistas\" for their cultish zeal, this influential cadre believed the doctrine would be the perfect solution\nfor Afghanistan. All they needed was a general with enough charisma and political savvy to implement it.\nAs McChrystal leaned on Obama to ramp up the war, he did it with the same fearlessness he used to track down terrorists\nin Iraq: Figure out how your enemy operates, be faster and more ruthless than everybody else, then take the fuckers out.\nAfter arriving in Afghanistan last June, the general conducted his own policy review, ordered up by Defense Secretary\nRobert Gates. The now-infamous report was leaked to the press, and its conclusion was dire: If we didn't send another\n40,000 troops \u2014 swelling the number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan by nearly half \u2014 we were in danger of \"mission failure.\"\nThe White House was furious. McChrystal, they felt, was trying to bully Obama, opening him up to charges of being weak\non national security unless he did what the general wanted. It was Obama versus the Pentagon, and the Pentagon was\ndetermined to kick the president's ass.\nLast fall, with his top general calling for more troops, Obama launched a three-month review to re-evaluate the strategy in\nAfghanistan. \"I found that time painful,\" McChrystal tells me in one of several lengthy interviews. \"I was selling an\nunsellable position.\" For the general, it was a crash course in Beltway politics \u2014 a battle that pitted him against\nexperienced Washington insiders like Vice President Biden, who argued that a prolonged counterinsurgency campaign in\nAfghanistan would plunge America into a military quagmire without weakening international terrorist networks. \"The entire\nCOIN strategy is a fraud perpetuated on the American people,\" says Douglas Macgregor, a retired colonel and leading\ncritic of counterinsurgency who attended West Point with McChrystal. \"The idea that we are going to spend a trillion\ndollars to reshape the culture of the Islamic world is utter nonsense.\nIn the end, however, McChrystal got almost exactly what he wanted. On December 1st, in a speech at West Point, the\npresident laid out all the reasons why fighting the war in Afghanistan is a bad idea: It's expensive; we're in an economic\ncrisis; a decade-long commitment would sap American power; Al Qaeda has shifted its base of operations to Pakistan.\nThen, without ever using the words \"victory\" or \"win,\" Obama announced that he would send an additional 30,000 troops\nto Afghanistan, almost as many as McChrystal had requested. The president had thrown his weight, however hesitantly,\nbehind the counterinsurgency crowd.\nToday, as McChrystal gears up for an offensive in southern Afghanistan, the prospects for any kind of success look bleak.\nIn June, the death toll for U.S. troops passed 1,000, and the number of IEDs has doubled. Spending hundreds of billions\nof dollars on the fifth-poorest country on earth has failed to win over the civilian population, whose attitude toward U.S.\ntroops ranges from intensely wary to openly hostile. Thetiggest military operation of the year \u2014 a ferocious offensive that\nbegan in February to retake the southern town of Marja \u2014 continues to drag on, prompting McChrystal himself to refer to it\nas a \"bleeding ulcer.\" In June, Afghanistan officially outpaced Vietnam as the longest war in American history \u2014 and\nObama has quietly begun to back away from the deadline he set for withdrawing U.S. troops in July of next year. The\npresident finds himself stuck in something even more insane than a quagmire: a quagmire he knowingly walked into, even\nthough it's precisely the kind of gigantic, mind-numbing, multigenerational nation-building project he explicitly said he\ndidn't want.\nEven those who support McChrystal and his strategy of counterinsurgency know that whatever the general manages to\naccomplish in Afghanistan, it's going to look more like Vietnam than Desert Storm. \"It's not going to look like a win, smell\nlike a win or taste like a win,\" says Maj. Gen. Bill Mayville, who serves as chief of operations for McChrystal. \"This is going\nto end in an argument.\"\nThe night after his speech in Paris, McChrystal and his staff head to Kitty O'Shea's, an Irish pub catering to tourists,\naround the corner from the hotel. His wife, Annie, has joined him for a rare visit: Since the Iraq War began in 2003, she\nhas seen her husband less than 30 days a year. Though it is his and Annie's 33rd wedding anniversary, McChrystal has\ninvited his inner circle along for dinner and drinks at the \"least Gucci\" place his staff could find. His wife isn't surprised.\n\"He once took me to a Jack in the Box when I was dressed in formalwear,\" she says with a laugh.\nThe general's staff is a handpicked collection of killers, spies, geniuses, patriots, political operators and outright maniacs.\nThere's a former head of British Special Forces, two Navy Seals, an Afghan Special Forces commando, a lawyer, two\nfighter pilots and at least two dozen combat veterans and counterinsurgency experts. They jokingly refer to themselves as\nTeam America, taking the name from the South Park-esque sendup of military cluelessness, and they pride themselves\non their can-do attitude and their disdain for authority. After arriving in Kabul last summer, Team America set about\nchanging the culture of the International Security Assistance Force, as the NATO-led mission is known. (U.S. soldiers had\ntaken to deriding ISAF as short for \"I Suck at Fighting\" or \"In Sandals and Flip-Flops.\") McChrystal banned alcohol on\nbase, kicked out Burger King and other symbols of American excess, expanded the morning briefing to include thousands\nof officers and refashioned the command center into a Situational Awareness Room, a free-flowing information hub\nmodeled after Mayor Mike Bloomberg's offices in New York. He also set a manic pace for his staff, becoming legendary\nfor sleeping four hours a night, running seven miles each morning, and eating one meal a day. (In the month I spend\naround the general, I witness him eating only once.) It's a kind of superhuman narrative that has built up around him, a\nstaple in almost every media profile, as if the ability to go without sleep and food translates into the possibility of a man\nsingle-handedly winning the war.\nBy midnight at Kitty O'Shea's, much of Team America is completely shitfaced. Two officers do an Irish jig mixed with steps\nfrom a traditional Afghan wedding dance, while McChrystal's top advisers lock arms and sing a slurred song of their own\ninvention.\"Afghanistan!\" they bellow.\"Afghanistan!\" They call it their Afghanistan song.\nMcChrystal steps away from the circle, observing his team. \"All these men,\" he tells me. \"I'd die for them. And they'd die\nfor me.\"\nThe assembled men may look and sound like a bunch of combat veterans letting off steam, but in fact this tight-knit group\nrepresents the most powerful force shaping U.S. policy in Afghanistan. While McChrystal and his men are in indisputable\ncommand of all military aspects of the war, there is no equivalent position on the diplomatic or political side. Instead, an\nassortment of administration players compete over the Afghan portfolio: U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry, Special\nRepresentative to Afghanistan Richard Holbrooke, National Security Advisor Jim Jones and Secretary of State Hillary\nClinton, not to mention 40 or so other coalition ambassadors and a host of talking heads who try to insert themselves into\nthe mess, from John Kerry to John McCain. This diplomatic incoherence has effectively allowed McChrystal's team to call\nthe shots and hampered efforts to build a stable and credible government in Afghanistan. \"It jeopardizes the mission,\"\nsays Stephen Biddle, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who supports McChrystal. \"The military cannot\nby itself create governance reform.\"\nPart of the problem is structural: The Defense Department budget exceeds $600 billion a year, while the State\nDepartment receives only $50 billion. But part of the problem is personal: In private, Team McChrystal likes to talk shit\nabout many of Obama's top people on the diplomatic side. One aide calls Jim Jones, a retired four-star general and\nveteran of the Cold War, a \"clown\" who remains \"stuck in 1985.\" Politicians like McCain and Kerry, says another aide,\n\"turn up, have a meeting with Karzai, criticize him at the airport press conference, then get back for the Sunday talk\nshows. Frankly, it's not very helpful.\" Only Hillary Clinton receives good reviews from McChrystal's inner circle. \"Hillary\nhad Stan's back during the strategic review,\" says an adviser. \"She said, 'If Stan wants it, give him what he needs.'\"\nMcChrystal reserves special skepticism for Holbrooke, the official in charge of reintegrating the Taliban. \"The Boss says\nhe's like a wounded animal,\" says a member of the general's team. \"Holbrooke keeps hearing rumors that he's going to\nget fired, so that makes him dangerous. He's a brilliant guy, but he just comes in, pulls on a lever, whatever he can grasp\nonto. But this is COIN, and you can't just have someone yanking on shit.\"\nAt one point on his trip to Paris, McChrystal checks his BlackBerry. \"Oh, not another e-mail from Holbrooke,\" he groans. \"I\ndon't even want to open it.\" He clicks on the message and reads the salutation out loud, then stuffs the BladkBerry back in\nhis pocket, not bothering to conceal his annoyance.\n\"Make sure you don't get any of that on your leg,\" an aide jokes, referring to the e-mail.\nBy far the most crucial \u2014 and strained \u2014 relationship is between McChrystal and Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador.\nAccording to those close to the two men, Eikenberry \u2014 a retired three-star general who served in Afghanistan in 2002 and\n2005 \u2014 can't stand that his former subordinate is now calling the shots. He's also furious that McChrystal, backed by\nNATO's allies, refused to put Eikenberry in the pivotal role of viceroy in Afghanistan, which would have made him the\ndiplomatic equivalent of the general. The job instead went to British Ambassador Mark Sedwill \u2014 a move that effectively\nincreased McChrystal's influence over diplomacy by shutting out a powerful rival. \"In reality, that position needs to be filled\nby an American for it to have weight,\" says a U.S. official familiar with the negotiations.\nThe relationship was further strained in January, when a classified cable that Eikenberry wrote was leaked to The New\nYork Times. The cable was as scathing as it was prescient. The ambassador offered a brutal critique of McChrystal's\nstrategy, dismissed President Hamid Karzai as \"not an adequate strategic partner,\" and cast doubt on whether the\ncounterinsurgency plan would be \"sufficient\" to deal with Al Qaeda. \"We will become more deeply engaged here with no\nway to extricate ourselves,\" Eikenberry warned, \"short of allowing the country to descend again into lawlessness and\nchaos.\"\nMcChrystal and his team were blindsided by the cable. \"I like Karl, I've known him for years, but they'd never said\nanything like that to us before,\" says McChrystal, who adds that he felt \"betrayed\" by the leak. \"Here's one that covers his\nflank for the history books. Now if we fail, they can say, 'I told you so.'\"\nThe most striking example of McChrystal's usurpation of diplomatic policy is his handling of Karzai. It is McChrystal, not\ndiplomats like Eikenberry or Holbrooke, who enjoys the best relationship with the man America is relying on to lead\nAfghanistan. The doctrine of counterinsurgency requires a credible government, and since Karzai is not considered\ncredible by his own people, McChrystal has worked hard to make him so. Over the past few months, he has accompanied\nthe president on more than 10 trips around the country, standing beside him at political meetings, or shuras, in Kandahar.\nIn February, the day before the doomed offensive in Marja, McChrystal even drove over to the president's palace to get\nhim to sign off on what would be the largest military operation of the year. Karzai's staff, however, insisted that the\npresident was sleeping off a cold and could not be disturbed. After several hours of haggling, McChrystal finally enlisted\nthe aid of Afghanistan's defense minister, who persuaded Karzai's people to wake the president from his nap.\nThis is one of the central flaws with McChrystal's counterinsurgency strategy: The need to build a credible government\nputs us at the mercy of whatever tin-pot leader we've backed \u2014 a danger that Eikenberry explicitly warned about in his\ncable. Even Team McChrystal privately acknowledges that Karzai is a less-than-ideal partner. \"He's been locked up in his\npalace the past year,\" laments one of the general's top advisers. At times, Karzai himself has actively undermined\nMcChrystal's desire to put him in charge. During a recent visit to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Karzai met three U.S.\nsoldiers who had been wounded in Uruzgan province. \"General,\" he called out to McChrystal, \"I didn't even know we were\nfighting in Uruzgan!\"\nGrowing up as a military brat, McChrystal exhibited the mixture of brilliance and cockiness that would follow him\nthroughout his career. His father fought in Korea and Vietnam, retiring as a two-star general, and his four brothers all\njoined the armed services. Moving around to different bases, McChrystal took solace in baseball, a sport in which he\nmade no pretense of hiding his superiority: In Little League, he would call out strikes to the crowd before whipping a\nfastball down the middle.\nMcChrystal entered West Point in 1972, when the U.S. military was close to its all-time low in popularity. His class was the\nlast to graduate before the academy started to admit women. The \"Prison on the Hudson,\" as it was known then, was a\npotent mix of testosterone, hooliganism and reactionary patriotism. Cadets repeatedly trashed the mess hall in food fights,\nand birthdays were celebrated with a tradition called \"rat fucking,\" which often left the birthday boy outside in the snow or\nmud, covered in shaving cream. \"It was pretty out of control,\" says Lt. Gen. David Barno, a classmate who went on to\nserve as the top commander in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005. The class, filled with what Barno calls \"huge talent\" and\n\"wild-eyed teenagers with a strong sense of idealism,\" also produced Gen. Ray Odierno, the current commander of U.S.\nforces in Iraq.\nThe son of a general, McChrystal was also a ringleader of the campus dissidents \u2014 a dual role that taught him how to\nthrive in a rigid, top-down environment while thumbing his nose at authority every chance he got. He accumulated more\nthan 100 hours of demerits for drinking, partying and insubordination \u2014 a record that his classmates boasted made him a\n\"century man.\" One classmate, who asked not to be named, recalls finding McChrystal passed out in the shower after\ndowning a case of beer he had hidden under the sink. The troublemaking almost got him kicked out, and he spent hours\nsubjected to forced marches in the Area, a paved courtyard where unruly cadets were disciplined. \"I'd come visit, and I'd\nend up spending most of my time in the library, while Stan was in the Area,\" recalls Annie, who began dating McChrystal\nin 1973.\nMcChrystal wound up ranking 298 out of a class of 855, a serious underachievement for a man widely regarded as\nbrilliant. His most compelling work was extracurricular: As managing editor of The Pointer, the West Point literary\nmagazine, McChrystal wrote seven short stories that eerily foreshadow many of the issues he would confront in his\ncareer. In one tale, a fictional officer complains about the difficulty of training foreign troops to fight; in another, a 19-year-\nold soldier kills a boy he mistakes for a terrorist. In \"Brinkman's Note,\" a piece of suspense fiction, the unnamed narrator\nappears to be trying to stop a plot to assassinate the president. It turns out, however, that the narrator himself is the\nassassin, and he's able to infiltrate the White House: \"The President strode in smiling. From the right coat pocket of the\nraincoat I carried, I slowly drew forth my 32-caliber pistol. In Brinkman's failure, I had succeeded.\"\nAfter graduation, 2nd Lt. Stanley McChrystal entered an Army that was all but broken in the wake of Vietnam. \"We really\nfelt we were a peacetime generation,\" he recalls. \"There was the Gulf War, but even that didn't feel like that big of a deal.\"\nSo McChrystal spent his career where the action was: He enrolled in Special Forces school and became a regimental\ncommander of the 3rd Ranger Battalion in 1986. It was a dangerous position, even in peacetime \u2014 nearly two dozen\nRangers were killed in training accidents during the Eighties. It was also an unorthodox career path: Most soldiers who\nwant to climb the ranks to general don't go into the Rangers. Displaying a penchant for transforming systems he considers\noutdated, McChrystal set out to revolutionize the training regime for the Rangers. He introduced mixed martial arts,\nrequired every soldier to qualify with night-vision goggles on the rifle range and forced troops to build up their endurance\nwith weekly marches involving heavy backpacks.\nIn the late 1990s, McChrystal shrewdly improved his inside game, spending a year at Harvard's Kennedy School of\nGovernment and then at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he co-authored a treatise on the merits and drawbacks\nof humanitarian interventionism. But as he moved up through the ranks, McChrystal relied on the skills he had learned as\na troublemaking kid at West Point: knowing precisely how far he could go in a rigid military hierarchy without getting\ntossed out. Being a highly intelligent badass, he discovered, could take you far \u2014 especially in the political chaos that\nfollowed September 11th. \"He was very focused,\" says Annie. \"Even as a young officer he seemed to know what he\nwanted to do. I don't think his personality has changed in all these years.\"\nBy some accounts, McChrystal's career should have been over at least two times by now. As Pentagon spokesman\nduring the invasion of Iraq, the general seemed more like a White House mouthpiece than an up-and-coming commander\nwith a reputation for speaking his mind. When Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld made his infamous \"stuff happens\"\nremark during the looting of Baghdad, McChrystal backed him up. A few days later, he echoed the president's Mission\nAccomplished gaffe by insisting that major combat operations in Iraq were over. But it was during his next stint \u2014\noverseeing the military's most elite units, including the Rangers, Navy Seals and Delta Force \u2014 that McChrystal took part\nin a cover-up that would have destroyed the career of a lesser man.\nAfter Cpl. Pat Tillman, the former-NFL-star-turned-Ranger, was accidentally killed by his own troops in Afghanistan in April\n2004, McChrystal took an active role in creating the impression that Tillman had died at the hands of Taliban fighters. He\nsigned off on a falsified recommendation for a Silver Star that suggested Tillman had been killed by enemy fire.\n(McChrystal would later claim he didn't read the recommendation closely enough \u2014 a strange excuse for a commander\nknown for his laserlike attention to minute details.) A week later, McChrystal sent a memo up the chain of command,\nspecifically warning that President Bush should avoid mentioning the cause of Tillman's death. \"If the circumstances of\nCorporal Tillman's death become public,\" he wrote, it could cause \"public embarrassment\" for the president.\n\"The false narrative, which McChrystal clearly helped construct, diminished Pat's true actions,\" wrote Tillman's mother,\nMary, in her book Boots on the Ground by Dusk. McChrystal got away with it, she added, because he was the \"golden\nboy\" of Rumsfeld and Bush, who loved his willingness to get things done, even if it included bending the rules or skipping\nthe chain of command. Nine days after Tillman's death, McChrystal was promoted to major general.\nTwo years later, in 2006, McChrystal was tainted by a scandal involving detainee abuse and torture at Camp Nama in\nIraq. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, prisoners at the camp were subjected to a now-familiar litany of\nabuse: stress positions, being dragged naked through the mud. McChrystal was not disciplined in the scandal, even\nthough an interrogator at the camp reported seeing him inspect the prison multiple times. But the experience was so\nunsettling to McChrystal that he tried to prevent detainee operations from being placed under his command in\nAfghanistan, viewing them as a \"political swamp,\" according to a U.S. official. In May 2009, as McChrystal prepared for\nhis confirmation hearings, his staff prepared him for hard questions about Camp Nama and the Tillman cover-up. But the\nscandals barely made a ripple in Congress, and McChrystal was soon on his way back to Kabul to run the war in\nAfghanistan.\nThe media, to a large extent, have also given McChrystal a pass on both controversies. Where Gen. Petraeus is kind of a\ndweeb, a teacher's pet with a Ranger's tab, McChrystal is a snake-eating rebel, a \"Jedi\" commander, as Newsweek called\nhim. He didn't care when his teenage son came home with blue hair and a mohawk. He speaks his mind with a candor\nrare for a high-ranking official. He asks for opinions, and seems genuinely interested in the response. He gets briefings on\nhis iPod and listens to books on tape. He carries a custom-made set of nunchucks in his convoy engraved with his name\nand four stars, and his itinerary often bears a fresh quote from Bruce Lee. (\"There are no limits. There are only plateaus,\nand you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.\") He went out on dozens of nighttime raids during his time in Iraq,\nunprecedented for a top commander, and turned up on missions unannounced, with almost no entourage. \"The fucking\nlads love Stan McChrystal,\" says a British officer who serves in Kabul. \"You'd be out in Somewhere, Iraq, and someone\nwould take a knee beside you, and a corporal would be like 'Who the fuck is that?' And it's fucking Stan McChrystal.\"\nIt doesn't hurt that McChrystal was also extremely successful as head of the Joint Special Operations Command, the elite\nforces that carry out the government's darkest ops. During the Iraq surge, his team killed and captured thousands of\ninsurgents, including Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq. \"JSOC was a killing machine,\" says Maj. Gen.\nMayville, his chief of operations. McChrystal was also open to new ways of killing. He systematically mapped out terrorist\nnetworks, targeting specific insurgents and hunting them down \u2014 often with the help of cyberfreaks traditionally shunned\nby the military. \"The Boss would find the 24-year-old kid with a nose ring, with some fucking brilliant degree from MIT,\nsitting in the corner with 16 computer monitors humming,\" says a Special Forces commando who worked with McChrystal\nin Iraq and now serves on his staff in Kabul. \"He'd say, 'Hey \u2014 you fucking muscleheads couldn't find lunch without help.\nYou got to work together with these guys.'\"\nEven in his new role as America's leading evangelist for counterinsurgency, McChrystal retains the deep-seated instincts\nof a terrorist hunter. To put pressure on the Taliban, he has upped the number of Special Forces units in Afghanistan from\nfour to 19. \"You better be out there hitting four or five targets tonight,\" McChrystal will tell a Navy Seal he sees in the\nhallway at headquarters. Then he'll add, \"I'm going to have to scold you in the morning for it, though.\" In fact, the general\nfrequently finds himself apologizing for the disastrous consequences of counterinsurgency. In the first four months of this\nyear, NATO forces killed some 90 civilians, up 76 percent from the same period in 2009 \u2014 a record that has created\ntremendous resentment among the very population that COIN theory is intent on winning over. In February, a Special\nForces night raid ended in the deaths of two pregnant Afghan women and allegations of a cover-up, and in April, protests\nerupted in Kandahar after U.S. forces accidentally shot up a bus, killing five Afghans. \"We've shot an amazing number of\npeople,\" McChrystal recently conceded.\nDespite the tragedies and miscues, McChrystal has issued some of the strictest directives to avoid civilian casualties that\nthe U.S. military has ever encountered in a war zone. It's \"insurgent math,\" as he calls it \u2014 for every innocent person you\nkill, you create 10 new enemies. He has ordered convoys to curtail their reckless driving, put restrictions on the use of air\npower and severely limited night raids. He regularly apologizes to Hamid Karzai when civilians are killed, and berates\ncommanders responsible for civilian deaths. \"For a while,\" says one U.S. official, \"the most dangerous place to be in\nAfghanistan was in front of McChrystal after a 'civ cas' incident.\" The ISAF command has even discussed ways to make\nnot killing into something you can win an award for: There's talk of creating a new medal for \"courageous restraint,\" a\nbuzzword that's unlikely to gain much traction in the gung-ho culture of the U.S. military.\nBut however strategic they may be, McChrystal's new marching orders have caused an intense backlash among his own\ntroops. Being told to hold their fire, soldiers complain, puts them in greater danger. \"Bottom line?\" says a former Special\nForces operator who has spent years in Iraq and Afghanistan. \"I would love to kick McChrystal in the nuts. His rules of\nengagement put soldiers' lives in even greater danger. Every real soldier will tell you the same thing.\"\nIn March, McChrystal traveled to Combat Outpost JFM \u2014 a small encampment on the outskirts of Kandahar \u2014 to confront\nsuch accusations from the troops directly. It was a typically bold move by the general. Only two days earlier, he had\nreceived an e-mail from Israel Arroyo, a 25-year-old staff sergeant who asked McChrystal to go on a mission with his unit.\n\"I am writing because it was said you don't care about the troops and have made it harder to defend ourselves,\" Arroyo\nwrote.\nWithin hours, McChrystal responded personally: \"I'm saddened by the accusation that I don't care about soldiers, as it is\nsomething I suspect any soldier takes both personally and professionally \u2014 at least I do. But I know perceptions depend\nupon your perspective at the time, and I respect that every soldier's view is his own.\" Then he showed up at Arroyo's\noutpost and went on a foot patrol with the troops \u2014 not some bullshit photo-op stroll through a market, but a real live\noperation in a dangerous war zone.\nSix weeks later, just before McChrystal returned from Paris, the general received another e-mail from Arroyo. A 23-year-\nold corporal named Michael Ingram \u2014 one of the soldiers McChrystal had gone on patrol with \u2014 had been killed by an IED\na day earlier. It was the third man the 25-member platoon had lost in a year, and Arroyo was writing to see if the general\nwould attend Ingram's memorial service. \"He started to look up to you,\" Arroyo wrote. McChrystal said he would try to\nmake it down to pay his respects as soon as possible.\nThe night before the general is scheduled to visit Sgt. Arroyo's platoon for the memorial, I arrive at Combat Outpost JFM\nto speak with the soldiers he had gone on patrol with. JFM is a small encampment, ringed by high blast walls and guard\ntowers. Almost all of the soldiers here have been on repeated combat tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and have seen\nsome of the worst fighting of both wars. But they are especially angered by Ingram's death. His commanders had\nrepeatedly requested permission to tear down the house where Ingram was killed, noting that it was often used as a\ncombat position by the Taliban. But due to McChrystal's new restrictions to avoid upsetting civilians, the request had been\ndenied. \"These were abandoned houses,\" fumes Staff Sgt. Kennith Hicks. \"Nobody was coming back to live in them.\"\nOne soldier shows me the list of new regulations the platoon was given. \"Patrol only in areas that you are reasonably\ncertain that you will not have to defend yourselves with lethal force,\" the laminated card reads. For a soldier who has\ntraveled halfway around the world to fight, that's like telling a cop he should only patrol in areas where he knows he won't\nhave to make arrests. \"Does that make any fucking sense?\" asks Pfc. Jared Pautsch. \"We should just drop a fucking\nbomb on this place. You sit and ask yourself: What are we doing here?\"\nThe rules handed out here are not what McChrystal intended \u2014 they've been distorted as they passed through the chain of\ncommand \u2014 but knowing that does nothing to lessen the anger of troops on the ground. \"Fuck, when I came over here and\nheard that McChrystal was in charge, I thought we would get our fucking gun on,\" says Hicks, who has served three tours\nof combat. \"I get COIN. I get all that. McChrystal comes here, explains it, it makes sense. But then he goes away on his\nbird, and by the time his directives get passed down to us through Big Army, they're all fucked up \u2014 either because\nsomebody is trying to cover their ass, or because they just don't understand it themselves. But we're fucking losing this\nthing.\"\nMcChrystal and his team show up the next day. Underneath a tent, the general has a 45-minute discussion with some two\ndozen soldiers. The atmosphere is tense. \"I ask you what's going on in your world, and I think it's important for you all to\nunderstand the big picture as well,\" McChrystal begins. \"How's the company doing? You guys feeling sorry for\nyourselves? Anybody? Anybody feel like you're losing?\" McChrystal says.\n\"Sir, some of the guys here, sir, think we're losing, sir,\" says Hicks.\nMcChrystal nods. \"Strength is leading when you just don't want to lead,\" he tells the men. \"You're leading by example.\nThat's what we do. Particularly when it's really, really hard, and it hurts inside.\" Then he spends 20 minutes talking about\ncounterinsurgency, diagramming his concepts and principles on a whiteboard. He makes COIN seem like common sense,\nbut he's careful not to bullshit the men. \"We are knee-deep in the decisive year,\" he tells them. The Taliban, he insists, no\nlonger has the initiative \u2014 \"but I don't think we do, either.\" It's similar to the talk he gave in Paris, but it's not winning any\nhearts and minds among the soldiers. \"This is the philosophical part that works with think tanks,\" McChrystal tries to joke.\n\"But it doesn't get the same reception from infantry companies.\"\nDuring the question-and-answer period, the frustration boils over. The soldiers complain about not being allowed to use\nlethal force, about watching insurgents they detain be freed for lack of evidence. They want to be able to fight \u2014 like they\ndid in Iraq, like they had in Afghanistan before McChrystal. 'We aren't putting fear into the Taliban,\" one soldier says.\n\"Winning hearts and minds in COIN is a coldblooded thing,\" McChrystal says, citing an oft-repeated maxim that you can't\nkill your way out of Afghanistan. \"The Russians killed 1 million Afghans, and that didn't work.\"\n\"I'm not saying go out and kill everybody, sir,\" the soldier persists. \"You say we've stopped the momentum of the\ninsurgency. I don't believe that's true in this area. The more we pull back, the more we restrain ourselves, the stronger it's\ngetting.\"\n\"I agree with you,\" McChrystal says. \"In this area, we've not made progress, probably. You have to show strength here,\nyou have to use fire. What I'm telling you is, fire costs you. What do you want to do? You want to wipe the population out\nhere and resettle it?\"\nA soldier complains that under the rules, any insurgent who doesn't have a weapon is immediately assumed to be a\ncivilian. \"That's the way this game is,\" McChrystal says. \"It's complex. I can't just decide: It's shirts and skins, and we'll kill\nall the shirts.\"\nAs the discussion ends, McChrystal seems to sense that he hasn't succeeded at easing the men's anger. He makes one\nlast-ditch effort to reach them, acknowledging the death of Cpl. Ingram. \"There's no way I can make that easier,\" he tells\nthem. \"No way I can pretend it won't hurt. No way I can tell you not to feel that. . . . I will tell you, you're doing a great job.\nDon't let the frustration get to you.\" The session ends with no clapping, and no real resolution. McChrystal may have sold\nPresident Obama on counterinsurgency, but many of his own men aren't buying it.\nWhen it comes to Afghanistan, history is not on McChrystal's side. The only foreign invader to have any success here\nwas Genghis Khan \u2014 and he wasn't hampered by things like human rights, economic development and press scrutiny.\nThe COIN doctrine, bizarrely, draws inspiration from some of the biggest Western military embarrassments in recent\nmemory: France's nasty war in Algeria (lost in 1962) and the American misadventure in Vietnam (lost in 1975).\nMcChrystal, like other advocates of COIN, readily acknowledges that counterinsurgency campaigns are inherently messy,\nexpensive and easy to lose. \"Even Afghans are confused by Afghanistan,\" he says. But even if he somehow manages to\nsucceed, after years of bloody fighting with Afghan kids who pose no threat to the U.S. homeland, the war will do little to\nshut down Al Qaeda, which has shifted its operations to Pakistan. Dispatching 150,000 troops to build new schools,\nroads, mosques and water-treatment facilities around Kandahar is like trying to stop the drug war in Mexico by occupying\nArkansas and building Baptist churches in Little Rock. \"It's all very cynical, politically,\" says Marc Sageman, a former CIA\ncase officer who has extensive experience in the region. \"Afghanistan is not in our vital interest \u2014 there's nothing for us\nthere.\"\nIn mid-May, two weeks after visiting the troops in Kandahar, McChrystal travels to the White House for a high-level visit by\nHamid Karzai. It is a triumphant moment for the general, one that demonstrates he is very much in command \u2014 both in\nKabul and in Washington. In the East Room, which is packed with journalists and dignitaries, President Obama sings the\npraises of Karzai. The two leaders talk about how great their relationship is, about the pain they feel over civilian\ncasualties. They mention the word \"progress\" 16 times in under an hour. But there is no mention of victory. Still, the \u2022\nsession represents the most forceful commitment that Obama has made to McChrystal's strategy in months. \"There is no\ndenying the progress that the Afghan people have made in recent years \u2014 in education, in health care and economic\ndevelopment,\" the president says. \"As I saw in the lights across Kabul when I landed \u2014 lights that would not have been\nvisible just a few years earlier.\"\nIt is a disconcerting observation for Obama to make. During the worst years in Iraq, when the Bush administration had no\nreal progress to point to, officials used to offer up the exact same evidence of success. \"It was one of our first\nimpressions,\" one GOP official said in 2006, after landing in Baghdad at the height of the sectarian violence. \"So many\nlights shining brightly.\" So it is to the language of the Iraq War that the Obama administration has turned \u2014 talk of\nprogress, of city lights, of metrics like health care and education. Rhetoric that just a few years ago they would have\nmocked. \"They are trying to manipulate perceptions because there is no definition of victory \u2014 because victory is not even\ndefined or recognizable,\" says Celeste Ward, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation who served as a political\nadviser to U.S. commanders in Iraq in 2006. \"That's the game we're in right now. What we need, for strategic purposes, is\nto create the perception that we didn't get run off. The facts on the ground are not great, and are not going to become\ngreat in the near future.\"\nBut facts on the ground, as history has proven, offer little deterrent to a military determined to stay the course. Even those\nclosest to McChrystal know that the rising anti-war sentiment at home doesn't begin to reflect how deeply fucked up things\nare in Afghanistan. \"If Americans pulled back and started paying attention to this war, it would become even less popular,\"\na senior adviser to McChrystal says. Such realism, however, doesn't prevent advocates of counterinsurgency from\ndreaming big: Instead of beginning to withdraw troops next year, as Obama promised, the military hopes to ramp up its\ncounterinsurgency campaign even further. \"There's a possibility we could ask for another surge of U.S. forces next\nsummer if we see success here,\" a senior military official in Kabul tells me.\nBack in Afghanistan, less than a month after the White House meeting with Karzai and all the talk of \"progress,\"\nMcChrystal is hit by the biggest blow to his vision of counterinsurgency. Since last year, the Pentagon had been planning\nto launch a major military operation this summer in Kandahar, the country's second-largest city and the Taliban's original\nhome base. It was supposed to be a decisive turning point in the war \u2014 the primary reason for the troop surge that\nMcChrystal wrested from Obama late last year. But on June 10th, acknowledging that the military still needs to lay more\ngroundwork, the general announced that he is postponing the offensive until the fall. Rather than one big battle, like\nFallujah or Ramadi, U.S. troops will implement what McChrystal calls a \"rising tide of security.\" The Afghan police and\narmy will enter Kandahar to attempt to seize control of neighborhoods, while the U.S. pours $90 million of aid into the city\nto win over the civilian population.\nEven proponents of counterinsurgency are hard-pressed to explain the new plan. \"This isn't a classic operation,\" says a\nU.S. military official. \"It's not going to be Black Hawk Down. There aren't going to be doors kicked in.\" Other U.S. officials\ninsist that doors are going to be kicked in, but that it's going to be a kinder, gentler offensive than the disaster in Marja.\n\"The Taliban have a jackboot on the city,\" says a military official. \"We have to remove them, but we have to do it in a way\nthat doesn't alienate the population.\" When Vice President Biden was briefed on the new plan in the Oval Office, insiders\nsay he was shocked to see how much it mirrored the more gradual plan of counterterrorism that he advocated last fall.\n\"This looks like CT-plus!\" he said, according to U.S. officials familiar with the meeting.\nWhatever the nature of the new plan, the delay underscores the fundamental flaws of counterinsurgency. After nine years\nof war, the Taliban simply remains too strongly entrenched for the U.S. military to openly attack. The very people that\nCOIN seeks to win over \u2014 the Afghan people \u2014 do not want us there. Our supposed ally, President Karzai, used his\ninfluence to delay the offensive, and the massive influx of aid championed by McChrystal is likely only to make things\nworse. \"Throwing money at the problem exacerbates the problem,\" says Andrew Wilder, an expert at Tufts University who\nhas studied the effect of aid in southern Afghanistan. \"A tsunami of cash fuels corruption, delegitimizes the government\nand creates an environment where we're picking winners and losers\" \u2014 a process that fuels resentment and hostility\namong the civilian population. So far, counterinsurgency has succeeded only in creating a never-ending demand for the\nprimary product supplied by the military: perpetual war. There is a reason that President Obama studiously avoids using\nthe word \"victory\" when he talks about Afghanistan. Winning, it would seem, is not really possible.

For others, a place of historic and cultural ties. For all of us, a test of collective\ncommitment and resolve.\nSome may ask why a small nation in the middle of the Caribbean Sea should command our attention today. Why\ncountries in the Western Hemisphere, Europe, the Middle East and Asia should offer assistance to Haiti in the midst of a\nglobal economic downturn that has shaken us all.\nWe're gathered at this conference because what happens in Haiti will resound far beyond the Caribbean and beyond the\nAmericas. The success or failure of this one small nation has economic, social and political implications, not just for its 9\nmillion citizens, but for a region whose future will be shaped by the strength of our commitment to achieve economic\nrecovery, political progress and wider opportunity for people from Portland to Porto Alegre to Port-au-Prince.\nThe United States is here, first and foremost, because it is the right thing to do for our neighbor and friend. Our ties to\nHaiti reach back to the early years of both our nations and have endured for generations-through our struggles for\nindependence; through the defeat of slavery in Haiti, which inspired slaves and abolitionists in the U.S. to press on with\ntheir fight for freedom; and more recently, through the hundreds of thousands of Haitians who emigrated to the United\nStates and strengthened it through their contributions in politics, business, science, sports and culture-the benefits of\nwhich I experienced firsthand as a senator representing New York.\nWe are also here because we are committed to creating a hemisphere in which every nation-no matter their present\nlevel of wealth or current political circumstances-is moving in the same direction, toward greater peace, prosperity,\nfreedom and opportunity.\nWith Haiti, we have the chance through global cooperation and collaboration to stand in solidarity with a people who\nare seeking to march forward. A nation where small investments and assistance from other countries are beginning to\nreap dividends in economic growth, wider access to health care, stronger governmental institutions, greater safety and\nsecurity-and the higher quality of life that results when the material conditions of people's lives improve.\nToday, Haiti is the poorest nation in the hemisphere, with one of the region's biggest gaps between the haves and have-\nnots. But in 2006, Haiti had its highest economic growth since the 1990s. It is on track to reach the completion point for\nthe IMF's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative in the next few months, which means significant debt relief is on the\nway, which will free up approximately $4 million a month-money that Haiti can invest directly in improving the lives of\nits people and building a future of self-sufficiency and confidence.\nHaiti has the region's highest rate of HIV/AIDS, the highest rate of maternal mortality, and the highest rate of child\nmortality. But the numbers of HIV infections and child and maternal deaths are all coming down.\nNot long ago, Haiti endured three decades of a brutal dictatorship. But the national and presidential elections in 2006\njump-started Haiti's democracy, and President Preval and Prime Minister Pierre Louis are seeking to maintain a strong\ncommitment to democratic governance, which will take another step forward on Sunday with elections for the Senate.\nLike many nations, including the United States, Haiti struggles against crime, particularly the global scourge of drug\ntrafficking. But reforms to improve policing, strengthen the justice system and fight corruption are now underway, and\na peacekeeping force led by Brazil has helped bring stability to many Haitian communities.\nHaiti made these strides with help from its own citizens and many of the nations and institutions represented here\ntoday. And this progress did not come only through government-to-government partnerships, but also through links\namong businesses, universities, NG0s, religious and cultural groups, and individuals-the full range of resources and\nrelationships, which is the heart of smart power.\nThat trajectory of progress has been undermined by the combined winds of hurricanes and a global economic recession.\nHaiti is in danger of stalling.\nThis conference gives us an opportunity to reignite its path to progress and work as a team-with Haiti at the helm-to\nadvance a comprehensive, long-term strategy for Haiti's growth, by coordinating hemispheric and international efforts,\ntargeting clear goals, and deploying our diverse skills and resources efficiently and effectively.\nPresident Preval and Prime Minister Pierre Louis have identified what help Haiti needs to get back on track. With these\npriorities as our guide and Haiti as our partner, we can make high-impact investments that will help lay the foundation\nfor stronger democratic institutions, a vibrant civil society, and an open market economy that creates more stability,\nattracts international investment, and offers more jobs and wider economic opportunities for Haiti and our region as a\nwhole.\nNow is the time to step up our investment in Haiti-not because the situation is so dire, but because the consequences of\ninaction could lead to significantly larger costs in both human and financial terms down the road.\nWith $100, we can pay for a year of schooling for one Haitian child or immunize five. That's a tiny fraction of the cost of\nsolving these problems if they escalate over time.\nThe United States will target our support toward three areas that the Haitian government has requested, which are\naimed at promoting conditions that are essential for national and regional progress.\nFirst, the Haitian people need to be secure. They must be able to travel safely to work and school and participate in the\ncivic lives of their communities without fear of violence.\nSecond, the country needs stronger infrastructure, particularly roads, which are the circulatory system of any robust\neconomy. Meanwhile, the people of Haiti are ready to work, but jobs are in short supply. We can accomplish two things\nat once by putting people to work building roads and other infrastructure throughout Haiti.\nAnd third, last year's hurricanes blew a hole in the government's budget.\nNow Haiti is facing a huge deficit, which will make it harder to provide services in the short-term or fund major projects\nin the long-term. Their debt obligations further constrain their ability to lay the groundwork for the future.\nOn each of these issues-security, jobs and infrastructure, and debt relief-the United States is lending its assistance and\nseeking to partner with other nations to maximize our collective impact.\nFirst, security. Effective international partnerships have already helped stem violence and improve security in Haiti. Cite\nSoleil, for example, was a no-man's-land for years, but today, violence has subsided and a new sense of freedom is felt in\nthe streets.\nThe Haitian National Police have been supported in their work by the UN peacekeeping operation in Haiti, which is the\nfirst in the hemisphere in which Latin American and Caribbean nations have participated. Brazil has led the mission with\ndetermination and skill. This level of engagement and collaboration is a major step forward for our region.\nBut criminal networks operating in Haiti have not been eliminated. Haiti continues to fight drug traffickers who have\nmade this country a distribution point for illegal drugs headed to the United States, Canada and Europe.\nDrug trafficking is a problem that involves many nations, all of which have a role to play in ending this deadly trade. That\nincludes the United States. We will give $2 million to fight drug trafficking in Haiti through the Merida Initiative, a plan\nconceived by Mexico, Central America and the United States. This money will fund a secure communications network\nfor the Haitian police; provide a maritime base, vehicles and operational support for police drug units; provide training\nto promote cross-border cooperation between Haiti and the Dominican Republic; and sharpen the investigation and\nprosecution of drug crimes.\nOnce security is established, opportunity can take root. Nations from Canada to Spain to Japan offered generous\nassistance to help repair the damage from last year's storms. Now it is time to take the next step-to move beyond\npeacekeeping and disaster relief to long-term reconstruction and development.\nHaiti has the highest unemployment rate in the hemisphere; 70 percent of its people don't have jobs. It also has one of\nthe region's highest population growth rates. Together, these trends have created what one development expert has\ncalled a \"youth tsunami\"-nearly 1 million youths are expected to come into the job market in the next five years.\nTo spur the creation of jobs, the United States passed the HOPE Act in 2006, to give garments made in Haiti tariff-free\naccess to the U.S. market. Last October, we extended this trade preference for another decade. Apparel is one of the\nlargest sectors in Haiti's economy. We see great potential for job creation in this field, and we are gratified by Brazil's\ninterest in supporting the Haitian apparel industry as well.\nBut to build a diversified economy, Haiti needs more than trade deals. It also needs the infrastructure to support the\nflow of goods and services. The roads in Haiti are beyond inadequate; many communities are isolated by the lack of a\npassable road, which prevents people from holding jobs, children from going to school, and farmers from bringing their\ncrops to market.\nBetter roads could facilitate greater trade and bring more Haitians into the global economy.\nHaiti also needs better roads in tourist areas, to promote that sector of the economy. Other urgent infrastructure needs\ninclude digging water catchments to prevent floods, completing a garment workers' training center, and creating canals\nto help irrigation.\nAs part of the $287 million in non-emergency assistance we will provide to Haiti this year, we have authorized $20\nmillion in aid to generate jobs, to help people put their skills to work building their country's future. We look forward to\nworking with Haiti to distribute that money quickly and effectively, to trigger a virtuous circle for long-term economic\ngrowth.\nAll the fiscal responsibility in the world can't prevent a natural disaster.\nThe hurricanes didn't just wash away crops and houses; they also washed away\nmonths of government planning for the future. Haiti is facing an\napproximately $50 million budget deficit, which could undermine Haiti's long-term ambitions as well as services that\npeople depend on to survive.\nThe United States will provide $20 million to pay Haiti's upcoming debt service obligations, to free Haiti to use its\nresources to fill that budget gap.\n[There is a fourth urgent need that the United States is committed to helping Haiti resolve. The combined effect of\nrising food prices globally and the destruction of crops by the hurricanes have exposed millions of Haitians to\nmalnutrition and its destructive effects on health and productivity. Malnourished people are often too weak to work;\nchronically hungry children struggle to learn in school. Food insecurity is not only a source of suffering, but a direct\nthreat to economic growth and global stability. The United States will provide a $15-million in-kind contribution of food\nto help Haiti as it continues to rebuild. ]\nThese are some of the ways in which the United States is ready to partner with Haiti and other nations. But there are\nadditional pieces of the larger mission that need support-from helping Haiti adapt to climate change so future\nhurricanes won't claim thousands of lives; to strengthening health systems; promoting sustainable agriculture; and\ndeveloping civil society.\nThis work is not only a matter for governments, but also a mission for our people. Here in the U.S., I have heard from\nmany individuals and groups who care about Haiti and want to help it develop but don't know how to invest their time\nand money in a way that will make a real impact. We should think creatively about helping people outside government\nget involved in a meaningful way with Haiti's future. Our people are our most valuable resource, and their potential to\nhelp in places like Haiti has not yet been tapped.\nWe know from empirical data that small investments go a long way. This is something I've seen for myself in my own\nvisits to Haiti. I traveled there with my husband shortly after our wedding, and again years later as First Lady. I met a\ndoctor who had emigrated to the United States and became a U.S. Air Force Colonel, but returned to his home town of\nPignon to run a center for health, women's literacy and microcredit. He and his staff had few resources, but they\noffered a comprehensive range of services to thousands of clients.\nI visited a family-planning clinic where young people were trained to educate their peers about how to protect their\nhealth and prevent teen pregnancy.\nAnd I met with women from a group called Women in Democracy. These women had attended a global conference on\nwomen's leadership in Montevideo, Uruguay, and when they returned home, they created this organization to support\nHaitian women running for office.\nEleven years later, their organization is larger and stronger than ever, and so is their mission. In addition to supporting\nwomen candidates, they also hold trade fairs for women entrepreneurs, run civic education programs to teach women\ntheir rights, support women journalists, and build connections between women throughout the Caribbean.\nThese Haitian women remind us that we will never achieve real progress if we leave millions of people behind. And they\ndemonstrate a powerful commitment on the part of the Haitian people to participate in and lead their nation's recovery.\nOur role is to support their work however we can, and to demonstrate through our actions our belief that their future is\nas important as our own.\nWhat happens next in Haiti will send a message to the world about the power of collaboration on behalf of every poor\nnation that has worked hard to earn a foothold in the global economy but has tumbled in recent months.\nOn behalf of every man and woman in the hemisphere, from the northern expanses of Canada to the southern tip of\nArgentina, who is working harder than ever with fewer resources and for smaller rewards. and the children whose\nfutures have been jeopardized by forces far beyond their control. let us prove our commitment to an economic recovery\nthat reaches not only the citizens of our individual nations but all people everywhere.", "nbr_mention": 10, "sentiment": 0, "sentence": " haiti continues to fight drug traffickers who have\nmade this country a distribution point for illegal drugs headed to the united states, canada and europe"}, "Jamaica": {"mention": ["jamaica", "jamaica"], "text": "Fyi\nMills, Cheryl D <MillsCD@state.gov>\nSaturday, May 09, 2009 7:17 AM\nFw: Tom in Jamaica", "nbr_mention": 2, "sentiment": -1, "sentence": "gov>\nsaturday, may 09, 2009 7:17 am\nfw: tom in jamaica"}, "Moldova, Republic of": {"mention": ["moldova", "moldova", "moldova", "moldova", "moldova", "moldova", "moldova", "moldova", "moldova", "moldova"], "text": "Here is an assessment from EUR:\nRe: s comments on Romania/Moldova\n1.4(B)\n1.4(D)\nIn\nE31\n2006, he said, \"We are the only country, the only people, which remain still divided.

In exchange, she said, African leaders must deliver democracy and good government.\nMrs. Clinton vowed to stay on top of Africa, even after she gets back to Washington, closely monitoring the issues she\naddressed on her tour. She also pointed to Cape Verde, a set of palm-studded islands best known for their beaches and\nenormous tourist hotels, as an example of what good leadership can do.\n\"This is possible,\" she said. \"You create not just economic growth but a sense of human dignity and possibility.\"\nKenya. South Africa. Angola. Congo. Nigeria. Liberia. And finally Cape Verde. Mrs. Clinton saw with her own eyes some of\nAfrica's most promising countries - and some of its most troubled ones. In Kenya, she pushed for the government to\nprosecute perpetrators of the postelection violence last year. In South Africa, the big issue was Zimbabwe and how the\nSouth African government should do more to help ease the crisis there.\nIn Angola, the theme was good governing practices and oil, a strategic concern of the United States given the many\ninroads China has made there and elsewhere in Africa in its hunger for natural resources. In Congo, Mrs. Clinton was\npassionate about the need to end the nation's rape epidemic.\n\"The secretary's visit to the heart of the world's deadliest war zone in eastern Congo was a potential game-changer for\nthat conflict,\" said John Prendergast, a founder of the Washington-based Enough project. \"Her commitment to\naddressing root causes such as the conflict minerals that power our electronics industry was a refreshing contrast to the\nusual disaster sympathy tourism of visiting dignitaries.\"\n\"Now,\" he added, \"comes the hard part: making good on the promises and living up to the high expectations\nengendered by her visit.\"\nIn Nigeria, Mrs. Clinton pressed for electoral changes. In Liberia, she praised the country's president, Ellen Johnson\nSirleaf, the only woman in Africa to be elected head of state.\nThe Liberian visit had a special warmth, almost like a meeting of long-lost cousins. Liberia was founded in the 19th\ncentury by freed American slaves, and the country's flag, the people's names and even the police uniforms with plastic-\nbrimmed hats were all reminiscent of the American versions. Mrs. Clinton received possibly her most exuberant\nwelcome there, and a Liberian man with a long wooden horn followed her around most of the visit, blowing out loud\nfunny noises whenever she said something striking.\n\"I love that - the horn - I want to take that guy with me wherever I go,\" she said.\nIn Cape Verde, Mrs. Clinton seemed to have few bones to pick. For once, she said, she had a cheat sheet on a country\nthat included a list of far more positives than negatives. The country has fewer than 500,000 people and has escaped the\nturmoil that has engulfed so much of Africa. The all-inclusive, poolside buffet resorts here feel like something found in\nCanctIn or the Bahamas.\nMrs. Clinton called Cape Verde \"a model of democracy and economic progress in Africa.\"\nOn Friday, just as she had at every stop, she started her speech by saying, \"I bring you greetings from President Obama.\"\nShe called him a \"son of Africa\" and said that under the Obama administration, the United States was determined to\nhelp Africa reach its promise.\n###", "nbr_mention": 1, "sentiment": -1, "sentence": " in south africa, the big issue was zimbabwe and how the\nsouth african government should do more to help ease the crisis there"}}
