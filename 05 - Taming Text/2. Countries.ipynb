He spent 10 years as an information management officer\\nin the State Department, he was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary\\nassignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather, with whom I spoke this morning. He was a\\nfather to two young children, Samantha and Nathan.

How\\ncould this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from destruction?\\nThis question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be.\\nBut we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group â€”\\nnot the people or Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a\\ncountry scarred by war and tyranny, they were hailed as friends and partners. And when the\\nattack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post.

And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the\\nviolence and pledged every effort to protect our people and pursue those responsible.\\nThe friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty\\nof this attack. A free and stable Libya is still in America\\'s interest and security, and we will not\\nturn our back on that, nor will we rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and\\nbrought to justice.

We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American\\nembassies, consulates, and citizens.\\nThere will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do.

Yesterday, I spoke about two: Ambassador Chris Stevens and Information\\nManagement Officer Sean Smith. Today, we also recognize the two security personnel who died\\nhelping protect their colleagues. Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty were both decorated\\nmilitary veterans who served our country with honor and distinction. Our thoughts, prayers, and\\ndeepest gratitude are with their families and friends. Our embassies could not carry on our\\ncritical work around the world without the service and sacrifice of brave people like Tyrone and\\nGlen.\\nTyrone\\'s friends and colleagues called him \"Rone,\" and they relied on his courage and skill,\\nhoned over two decades as a Navy SEAL. In uniform, he served multiple tours in Iraq and\\nAfghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in dangerous posts from\\nCentral America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well as the arm of a warrior,\\nearning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. All our hearts go out to\\nTyrone\\'s wife Dorothy and his three sons, Tyrone Jr., Hunter, and Kai, who was born just a few\\nmonths ago.\\nWe also grieve for Glen Doherty, called Bub, and his family: his father Bernard, his mother\\nBarbara, his brother Gregory, and his sister Kathleen. Glen was also a former Navy SEAL and an\\nexperienced paramedic. And he put his life on the line many times, protecting Americans in Iraq,\\nAfghanistan, and other hotspots. In the end, he died the way he lived â€” with selfless honor and\\nunstinting valor.\\nWe condemn the attack that took the lives of these heroes in the strongest terms, and we are\\ntaking additional steps to safeguard American embassies, consulates, and citizens around the\\nworld.

Well, let me welcome our friends and colleagues\\nfrom Morocco here to the Benjamin Franklin Room on the eighth floor of the State Department\\nfor this very important first session of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue. Before I begin to\\naddress the significance of this Strategic Dialogue and the next step in our long relations with\\nMorocco, I want to say a few words about the events unfolding in the world today.\\nWe are closely watching what is happening in Yemen and elsewhere, and we certainly hope and\\nexpect that there will be steps taken to avoid violence and prevent the escalation of protests into\\nviolence.\\nI also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to these\\nprotests in a number of countries. Let me state very clearly â€” and I hope it is obvious â€” that the\\nUnited States Government had absolutely nothing to do with this video. We absolutely reject its\\ncontent and message. America\\'s commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very\\nbeginning of our nation. And as you know, we are home to people of all religions, many of\\nwhom came to this country seeking the right to exercise their own religion, including, of course,\\nmillions of Muslims. And we have the greatest respect for people of faith.\\nTo us, to me personally, this video is disgusting and reprehensible. It appears to have a deeply\\ncynical purpose: to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage. But as I said yesterday, there\\nis no justification, none at all, for responding to this video with violence, We condemn the\\nviolence that has resulted in the strongest terms, and we greatly appreciate that many Muslims in\\nthe United States and around the world have spoken out on this issue.\\nViolence, we believe, has no place in religion and is no way to honor religion. Islam, like other\\nreligions, respects the fundamental dignity of human beings, and it is a violation of that\\nfundamental dignity to wage attacks on innocents. As long as there are those who are willing to\\nshed blood and take innocent life in the name of religion, the name of God, the world will never\\nknow a true and lasting peace. It is especially wrong for violence to be directed against\\ndiplomatic missions. These are places whose very purpose is peaceful: to promote better\\nunderstuiding across countries and cultures. All governments have a responsibility to protect\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739812\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Now, I would\\nnote that in today\\'s world with today\\'s technologies, that is impossible. But even if it were\\npossible, our country does have a long tradition of free expression which is enshrined in our\\nConstitution and our law, and we do not stop individual citizens from expressing their views no\\nmatter how distasteful they may be.\\nThere are, of course, different views around the world about the outer limits of free speech and\\nfree expression, but there should be no debate about the simple proposition that violence in\\nresponse to speech is not acceptable. We all â€” whether we are leaders in government, leaders in\\ncivil society or religious leaders â€” must draw the line at violence. And any responsible leader\\nshould be standing up now and drawing that line.\\nI wanted to begin with this statement, because, as our Moroccan friends and all of you know, this\\nhas been a difficult week at the State Department. I very much appreciate, Minister, the\\ncondolences your government expressed to our Embassy in Rabat And even though that tragedy\\nhappened far away in Benghazi, we found a reminder of the deep bounds that connect Morocco\\nto the United States. It was in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco that one of the Americans\\nwe lost this week, Ambassador Chris Stevens, fell in love with the region when he served as a\\nPeace Corps volunteer there. That experience set him on a decades-long career of service. So in\\nthe memory of fallen friends and colleagues, let us remind ourselves of the many ways in which\\nriot just our governments but the people of our two nations have worked together to build a better\\nfuture.\\nIn many ways, the United States looks to Morocco to be a leader and a model. His Majesty King\\nMohammed deserves great credit for the work you\\'ve undertaken. In fact, after my visit to Rabat\\nearlier this year. I told my team: \"We need to start a Strategic Dialogue with Morocco.\" No\\ncountry has been a friend of the United States longer than Morocco. You were the first nation to\\nrecognize us back in 1777. But we\\'re not satisfied with simply having a friendship that is\\nlongstanding We want one that is dynamic, growing, looking toward the future. So let me\\nhighlight a few of the areas we should focus on today.\\nOn political reform, we have all seen remarkable changes taking place across North Africa and\\nthe Middle East. I commend Morocco and your government for your efforts to stay ahead of\\nthese changes by holding free and fair elections, empowering the elected parliament, taking other\\nsteps to ensure that the government reflects the will of the people. Today, our political working\\ngroup will discuss how the United States can continue to support your efforts to translate\\ncommitments into actions. Because as we all know, democracy, real reform, require that people\\nthemselves feel the changes in their evetyday lives: the courts reformed, the government more\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739812\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

We know that child brides are less likely to get an education, more likely to face\\nlife-threatening problems, particularly around child birth and delivery, which not only\\nshortchanges them but can even rob them and their communities of their lives and talents. So we\\nwant to encourage the government and civil society to continue their important work together on\\nthis issue.\\nWith regard to the Western Sahara, the United States continues to support efforts to find a\\npeaceful, sustainable, mutually agreed-upon solution. U.S. policy toward the Western Sahara has\\nremained consistent for many years. We have made clear that Morocco\\'s autonomy plan is\\nserious, realistic, and credible, and that it represents a potential approach that could satisfy the\\naspirations of the people in the Western Sahara to run their own affairs in peace and dignity. We\\ncontinue to support the negotiations carried out by the United Nations and hope parties can work\\ntoward resolution.\\nWith respect to the economy, our second working group will focus on what more can be done to\\ndeliver tangible economic benefits. Morocco\\'s economy is relatively healthy, but you face the\\nsame problem that is now endemic across the world â€” unemployment is still too high, especially\\namong young people.\\nThat\\'s why the United States is providing $1.5 million to support an effort to attract foreign\\ninvestors, foster local economic development, and combat corruption across the region. And I\\'m\\npleased to announce that later this year we will hold a Morocco business development\\nconference here in Washington to connect businesses from both countries.\\nToday, we should discuss ways to build on all of these efforts by increasing bilateral trade, a\\nparticular goal of mine since so much trade from Morocco goes to Europe. I\\'d like to increase\\nthe amount of trade coming to the United States, and also to improve economic integration\\nacross North Africa, which could greatly benefit Morocco because of Morocco\\'s stability and\\nMorocco\\'s very strong economic foundation. The greater integration there is, the greater the\\nbenefits for Moroccans.\\nThird, the attack in Benghazi this week reminds us that security remains a vital issue. Through\\nour work together on the Global Counterterrorism Task Force, the United States and Morocco\\nalready share crucial information and best practices, and I thank Morocco for hosting a Global\\nCounterterrorism Task Force workshop on threats in the South Atlantic next month.\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739812\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

It\\'s one of the great\\nchallenges of the 21st century, and it\\'s one that we must address together.\\nSo we have a lot of work to do, Minister, but our friendship runs long and deep, and as the treaty\\nour nations signed in 1786 says, and I quote, \"Trusting in God, it will remain permanent.\" I\\'m\\nconfident that we will continue to solve problems and produce results that make our nations\\nstronger, more peaceful, more secure, more prosperous, and also contribute to doing the same for\\nthe world.\\nSo again, let me welcome you, Minister. It\\'s been a great pleasure for me to get to know you, to\\nwork with you, to be your colleague bilaterally, regionally, and globally, and also welcome your\\ndistinguished delegation.\\nThank you.

No matter how belated we are honoring Eid and the end of Ramadan, this is a\\ncherished tradition here at the State Department.

They were good and\\nbrave men. They were committed to the cause of building a brighter future for the people of\\nLibya. And we condemn the violence in the strongest terms, the violence against our posts in\\nBenghazi, in Egypt, and now in Yemen.\\nThe Libyan ambassador is with us tonight, and I want to take a moment to thank him for the\\nsupport that his government and the Libyan people have shown to the United States in this\\ntragedy, particularly the outpouring of feelings of grief and loss because of the killing of our\\nambassador.\\nAmbassador Aujali, would you mind saying a few words?\\nAMBASSADOR AMU: [redacted]\\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Ambassador. I know that that was a very\\npersonal loss for you, as it was for me. I\\'m the one who sent Chris to Benghazi during the\\nrevolution to show support and be able to advise our government about what we could do to\\nbring freedom and democracy and opportunity to the people of Libya.\\nReligious freedom and religious tolerance are essential to the stability of any nation, any people.\\nHatred and violence in the name of religion only poison the well. All people of faith and good\\nwill know that the actions of a small and savage group in Benghazi do not honor religion or God\\nin any way. Nor do they speak for the more than one billion Muslims around the world, many of\\nwhom have shown an outpouring of support during this time\\nUnfortunately, however, over the last 24 hours, we have also seen violence spread elsewhere.\\nSome seek to justify this behavior as a response to inflammatory, despicable material posted on\\nthe intemet. As I said earlier today, the United States rejects both the content and the message of\\nthat video. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of\\nothers. At our meeting earlier today, my colleague, the foreign minister of Morocco, said that all\\nprophets should be respected because they are all symbols of our humanity, for all humanity.\\nBut both of us were crystal clear in this paramount message: There is never any justification for\\nviolent acts of this kind. And we look to leaders around the world to stand up and speak out\\nagainst violence, and to take steps to protect diplomatic missions from attack.\\nThink about it. When Christians are subject to insults to their faith, and that certainly happens,\\nwe expect them not to resort to violence. When Hindus or Buddhists are subjected to insults to\\ntheir faiths, and that also certainly happens, we expect them not to resort to violence. The same\\ngoes for all faiths, including Islam.\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739812\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\\nWhen all of us who are people of faith - and I am one â€” feel the pain of insults, of\\nmisunderstanding, of denigration to what we cherish, we must expect ourselves and others not to\\nresort to violence, That is a universal standard and expectation, and it is everyone\\'s obligation to\\nmeet that, so that we make no differences, we expect no less of ourselves than we expect of\\nothers, You cannot respond to offensive speech with violence without begetting more violence.\\nAnd I so strongly believe that the great religions of the world are stronger than any insults. They\\nhave withstood offense for centuries. Refraining from violence, then, is not a sign of weakness in\\none\\'s faith; it is absolutely the opposite, a sign that one\\'s faith is unshakable.\\nSo tonight, we must come together and recommit ourselves to working toward a future marked\\nby understanding and acceptance rather than distrust, hatred, and fear. We can pledge that\\nwhenever one person speaks out in ignorance and bigotry, ten voices will answer. They will\\nanswer resoundingly against the offense and the insult, answering ignorance with enlightenment,\\nanswering hatred with understanding, answering darkness with light; that if one person commits\\na violent act in the name of religion, millions will stand up and condemn it out of strength.\\nIn times like these, it can be easy to despair that some differences are irreconcilable, some\\nmountains too steep to climb; we will therefore never reach the level of understanding and\\npeacefulness that we seek, and which I believe the great religions of the world call us to pursue.\\nBut that\\'s not what I believe, and I don\\'t think it\\'s what you believe either here tonight. Part of\\nwhat makes our country so special is we keep trying. We keep working. We keep investing in\\nour future. We keep supporting the next generation, believing that young people can keep us\\nmoving forward in a positive direction.\\nSo tonight I think it\\'s important that we talk not just about that better tomorrow that we all seek,\\nbut also about some of the things â€” the real, practical, tangible things â€” that young people are\\ndoing to help shape that better future.\\nTwo years ago in this room, at our Eid reception, we launched a program called Generation\\nChange to lead a grassroots agenda of positive engagement with Muslim communities. And I\\nasked the young Muslim leaders in the audience that night to be our unofficial ambassadors, to\\nhelp build personal connections, seek out partners in other countries. And I can report to you\\ntonight they did not disappoint. In a few minutes, you\\'re going to meet some of these young\\nleaders, each with a powerful story to tell.\\nThe Generation Change network that started in this room now circles the globe. We are building\\nan international alliance of young people who want to drive change in their own communities.\\nThey act as mentors, spark respectful debates, simply offer words of encouragement when\\nneeded. But most importantly, they inspire others to keep expanding the circle of mutual\\nunderstanding and respect, one person at a time.\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739812\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Our 2012 Hours Against Hate initiative encourages\\nyoung people to put themselves in another person\\'s shoes through service projects. So far, young\\npeople from all over the world have pledged thousands of volunteer hours to help people from a\\ndifferent background, to see them as a fellow human being, not a stereotype, not a caricature, but\\nanother real live person â€” people who don\\'t look like you, live like you, pray like you, but with\\nwhom we will share this planet.

I\\'m particularly pleased that the young people you will hear from\\ntonight are really setting an example, not only for young people elsewhere in the world but,\\nfrankly, for us who are older as well.\\nLet me now call to the stage someone who has been a tremendous assistance to me in these\\nefforts. Farah Pandith is the Department\\'s first Special Representative to Muslim Communities.\\nAnd from the beginning, she has made reaching out to young people and civil society her top\\npriority.

To the families of our fallen colleagues, I offer our most heartfelt condolences and\\ndeepest gratitude.\\nSean Smith joined the State Department after six years in the Air Force. He was respected as an\\nexpert on technology by colleagues in Pretoria, Baghdad, Montreal, and The Hague. He enrolled\\nin correspondence courses at Penn State and had high hopes for the future.

Our thoughts and prayers are with Glen\\'s father Bernard, his\\nmother Barbara, his brother Gregory, his sister Kathleen, and their grieving families, friends, and\\ncolleagues.\\nI was honored to know Ambassador Chris Stevens. I want to thank his parents and siblings, who\\nare here today, for sharing Chris with us and with our country. What a wonderful gift you gave\\nus. Over his distinguished career in the Foreign Service, Chris won friends for the United States\\nin far-flung places. He made those people\\'s hopes his own. During the revolution in Libya, he\\nrisked his life to help protect the Libyan people from a tyrant, and he gave his life helping them\\nbuild a better country.\\nPeople loved to work with Chris. And as he rose through the ranks, they loved to work for Chris.\\nHe was known not only for his courage but for his smile â€” goofy but contagious â€” for his sense\\nof fun and that California cool.\\nIn the days since the attack, so many Libyans â€” including the Ambassador from Libya to the\\nUnited States, who is with us today â€” have expressed their sorrow and solidarity. One young\\nwoman, her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness, held up a handwritten sign that said\\n\"Thugs and killers don\\'t represent Benghazi nor Islam,\" The President of the Palestinian\\nAuthority, who worked closely with Chris when he served in Jerusalem, sent me a letter\\nremembering his energy and integrity, and deploring â€” and I quote â€” \"an act of ugly terror.\"\\nMany others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments.\\nThis has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We\\'ve seen the\\nheavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We\\'ve seen rage\\nand violence directed at American embassies over an awful interne video that we had nothing to\\ndo with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because it is senseless, and it is\\ntotally unacceptable.\\nThe people of Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the\\ntyranny of a mob. Reasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do\\neverything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts. And\\nwe will, under the President\\'s leadership, keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the\\nworld.\\nThere will be more difficult days ahead, but it is important that we don\\'t lose sight of the\\nfundamental fact that America must keep leading the world.

And it is such a pleasure for me to\\nwelcome my friend and colleague, Secretary Espinosa, along with a very distinguished\\ndelegation of officials from the Mexican Government for this continuation of consultation at the\\nhighest levels of each of our governments.\\nBefore I turn to the matters discussed today, let me give a brief update on the ongoing U.S.\\nresponse to the protests in the Middle East and elsewhere. I\\'m sure as you know already, we are\\ntaking aggressive steps to protect our staffs in embassies and consulates worldwide. That\\nincludes reviewing our security posture at every post and augmenting it where necessary. And\\nwe are working closely with the Libyan Government in our efforts to bring to justice those who\\nmurdered our four American colleagues in Benghazi.\\nThe FBI is now in Tripoli to join the investigation with Libyan officials, and there is nothing\\nmore important to us than ensuring the safety of our American representatives worldwide. At the\\nsame time, as I have said to State Department employees, the incidents of the past week highlight\\nhow important our work is. The United States must and will remain strongly engaged in the\\nworld. Our men and women risk their lives in service to our country and our values, because they\\nknow that the United States must be a force for peace and progress. That is worth striving and\\nsacrificing for, and nothing that happened last week changes this fundamental fact.\\nNow, turning to our friends and partners in Mexico, we are always pleased to have a chance to\\ndiscuss matters of mutual interest and concern between us. Mexico is one of our closest friends\\nas well as partner on dozens of critical issues. So we talk about every kind of issue you can\\nimagine, from education and healthcare to poverty alleviation to the environment. But today, we\\nfocused on a top priority for us both a security.\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739812\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

And I want to offer\\nmy personal appreciation to President Calderon and to Foreign Secretary Espinosa for their\\nleadership and commitment to this partnership and to all on both sides of the border in our\\ngovernments who have been deeply engaged and committed to it. The Merida Initiative\\nrepresents an unprecedented level of security cooperation between Mexico and the United States.\\nAs our countries continue to deal with the serious challenge of transnational criminal\\norganizations, including drug traffickers, illegal arms traffickers, money launderers, and violent\\ngangs that threaten people on both sides of the border, we well know there is no quick and easy\\nway to stop these criminals and bring them to justice. But nevertheless, during the past now\\nnearly four years, our countries have collaborated to an extraordinary and unprecedented degree.\\nWe have brought together policy makers and experts from across our governments and societies\\nwho have worked hand in hand to keep our people safe. And I think the habits of cooperation we\\nhave built are among our most important achievements, and we will rely on them for a long time\\nto come.\\nToday, our delegations reviewed the gains we\\'ve made on key priorities, including improving\\nlaw enforcement coordination, reducing the demand for drugs, modernizing our border\\ninfrastructure, strengthening the rule of law, and building more resilient and empowered\\ncommunities. We also discussed the lessons we\\'ve learned and the work that lies ahead in these\\nand other areas, which our joint statement will reflect. I want to underscore how important our\\nsecurity relationship with Mexico is to the United States.\\nThe Government of Mexico and the Mexican people have faced the threat posed by these\\ncriminals with courage and resolve, and we remain committed to doing everything we can to\\nsupport Mexico as it continues to work to bring those criminals to justice. This is a transnational\\nproblem, and it calls for a transnational solution, and the United States believes this is a matter of\\nshared responsibility. That was the first message I brought as Secretary of State when I came to\\nMexico, and it continues to be the hallmark of our efforts together. Making sure our people are\\nsafe and our neighbors are safe is of the utmost importance to us.\\nNow, our two countries share many other priorities, and one of them, empowering women and\\ngirls, was also addressed today. We took the opportunity, the Foreign Secretary and I, to sign a\\nMemorandum of Understanding between our countries to work together to advance gender\\nequality, empower girls and women, promote their human rights, and enhance their security.\\nSo again, Secretary Espinosa, let me thank you for years of work and effort, for our productive\\nconversations in many places around the world and again today, and for being such a valuable\\ncolleague and partner. The United States deeply, deeply values our relationship with Mexico and\\nthe ties of family and friendship that connect so many millions of our people.\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739812\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Are you any closer to finding who killed\\nAmbassador Chris Stevens?, Libya\\'s President says this attack was planned for months. Are you\\nconfident he\\'s wrong and that security measures were appropriate? And will you leave justice to\\nthe Libyans?\\nSECRETARY CLINTON: As I said at the outset, we are taking aggressive steps to protect our\\npeople and our consulates and embassies around the world. We are reviewing our security\\nposture at every post and working with host governments to be sure they know what our security-\\nneeds are wherever necessary. We are also working closely with the Libyan Government to bring\\nthe perpetrators to justice so that we can be assured that we have found who murdered our four,\\ncolleagues and under what circumstances. As I said, the FBI has joined the investigation inside\\nLibya, and we will not rest until the people who orchestrated this attack are found and punished.\\nIt is also important to look at this strategically and understand what is going on across the region.\\nIn a number of places where protests have tuned violent, we are seeing the hand of extremists\\nwho are trying to exploit people\\'s inflamed passions for their own agendas. But overwhelmingly,\\nwe have found that the people of Egypt, of Libya, of Yemen and Tunisia are not prepared to\\ntrade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob. They want to turn their attention to the\\nfuture to provide better opportunities for themselves and their children, and they want a strong\\npartnership with the United States and the American people based on mutual interests and mutual\\nrespect.\\nThis is part of a larger debate that is going on inside these societies. In Libya, for example, in\\ntheir first free elections, moderates were successful at the polls. But look, there are extremists in\\nall of these societies and on the outside who are working to take advantage of broad outrage in\\norder to incite violence and specifically incite violence against Americans and American\\nfacilities.\\nAnd as I have said to many of the leaders I have spoken to over the past week, these extremist\\nefforts are a threat to the people of the societies and the governments of those societies as well as\\nto the region and the United States. And I think it\\'s important at this moment for leaders to put\\nthemselves on the right side of this debate - to speak out clearly and unequivocally against\\nviolence, whoever incites it or conducts it\\nAnd in a struggle like this, there can be no doubt where the United States must stand.

And I want to\\nunderscore that the United States will continue to work with partners and allies in the region and\\naround the world to help bring security to these nations so that the promise of the revolutions that\\nthey experienced can be realized.\\nAnd finally, on your specific point about Benghazi, we obviously never talk publicly about\\nsecurity at any of our missions for obvious reasons. But that said, let me assure you that our\\nsecurity in Benghazi included a unit of host government security forces, as well as a local guard\\nforce of the kind that we rely on in many places around the world. In addition to the security\\noutside the compound, we relied on a wall and a robust security presence inside the compound.\\nAnd with all of our missions overseas, in advance of September lid\\', as is done every year, we\\ndid an evaluation on threat streams. And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has\\nsaid we had no actionable intelligence that an attack on our post in Benghazi was planned or\\nimminent.\\nBut let me state the obvious again. Our diplomats engage in dangerous work, and it\\'s the nature\\nof diplomacy in fragile societies and conflict zones to be aware of the necessity for security but\\nto also continue the important diplomatic work that has to go on. There is risk inherent in what\\nwe do and what these brave men and women representing the United States are up against every\\nsingle day, and we do our very best to limit that risk by ensuring that our security protocols\\nreflect the environments in which diplomats work and the threats that they are presented with.\\nThank you.\\nRemarks With Indonesian Foreign Minister Raden Mohammad Marty Muliana\\nNatalegawa After Their Meeting\\nSeptember 20, 2012\\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it\\'s such a pleasure, as always, to\\nwelcome the Indonesian Foreign Minister, and I believe the largest delegation that has ever come\\nfrom Indonesia, for the purpose of our third meeting of the U.S.-Indonesia Joint Commission.\\nThis commission is the result of a vision by our two presidents for a comprehensive partnership,\\nand the agreement to that effect was signed in 2010. Thanks to this partnership, the United States\\nand Indonesia are working more closely than ever on a range of issues from global security to\\nclean energy and climate to regional trade and commerce.\\nAnd today, Marty and I had the chance to take stock of where our teams have come in the time\\nof the last year, because we liad our meeting in Bali a year ago.

We have condemned in the strongest possible terms the violence that has erupted from\\nthese protests. And as I have said, the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and\\nreprehensible, and the United States Government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it.\\nBut there is no justification for violence, and I want to thank the Foreign Minister and his\\ngovernment for speaking out against violence. We have to look to reasonable people and\\nresponsible leaders everywhere to stand up to extremists who would seek to take advantage of\\nthis moment to commit violent acts against embassies and their fellow countrymen.\\nToday\\'s meetings have highlighted the strong foundation that we have built together. And one of\\nour most important concerns is promoting peace and stability in the Asia Pacific. Today, I\\'m\\nannouncing that the Obama Administration has informed Congress of the potential sale of eight\\nAH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters to the Indonesian Government. This agreement will\\nstrengthen our comprehensive partnership and help enhance security across the region.\\nOn growth and prosperity, we are increasing our trade relationship that topped $26 billion last\\nyear. Investments in transportation, energy, and infrastructure are creating jobs and supporting\\neconomic growth in both countries. For example, the deal between Lion Air and Boeing alone\\nrepresents $21 billion in trade over the next decade. Indonesia\\'s Government has announced half\\na trillion dollars in infrastructure improvements, and we recently signed a memorandum of\\nunderstanding to make it easier for American companies to bid on these projects.\\nAnd yesterday, we signed an agreement for implementing our Millennium Challenge\\nCorporation Compact with Indonesia. Over the next five years, the United States will invest $600\\nmillion in clean energy development, child health and nutrition programs, and efforts to help\\nmake Indonesia\\'s Government more transparent and open.\\nThe United States is also looking forward to Indonesia hosting APEC in 2013, and we are\\nconfident that Indonesia will come to this role with a commitment to promote greater economic\\nintegration across the Asia Pacific.\\nBoth the Foreign Minister and I believe that strong education is essential to compete in a modem\\nglobal economy. That\\'s why the United States has expanded the Fulbright Program and\\nsupported partnerships between dozens of American and Indonesian universities. Academic\\nexchanges between our countries are up and applications from Indonesian students to visit the\\nUnited States have increased by one third. USAID has recently expanded its basic education\\nprogram to provide $83 million for teacher training and literacy programs for young children.\\nAnd we\\'re providing $20 in scholarship funding for Indonesian graduate students.\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739812\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

The Foreign Minister\\'s\\npersonal leadership has helped lay the groundwork for diplomacy between ASEAN and China as\\nit relates to the South China Sea. And we continue to support ASEAN\\'s six-point principles,\\nwhich we believe will help reduce tensions and pave the way for a comprehensive code of\\nconduct for addressing disputes without threats, coercion, or use of force.\\nFinally. Indonesia and the United States have stood together on a range of global challenges,\\nfrom democratic reform in Burma to combating climate change, to working to end the violence\\nin Syria. We are also coordinating efforts to further develop south-south and triangular\\ncooperation, such as enhancing disaster preparedness in Burma and convening a conference on\\nwomen\\'s empowerment.\\nWe believe that as the second and third-largest democracies in the world, the United States and\\nIndonesia have a special responsibility to promote democracy and human rights. And for the last\\nfour years, Indonesia has hosted the Bali Democracy Forum to promote peaceful, democratic\\ntransitions through example and open dialogue. Last year, more than 80 countries attended. And\\nonce again, the United States will be sending a high-level delegation.\\nSo, Minister, thank you for everything. Thank you for the great partnership we\\'ve had between\\nus and between our countries.\\nMS. NULAND: We\\'ll take two questions today, we\\'ll start with Ros Jordan of Al Jazeera\\nEnglish.\\nQUESTION: Thank you, Madam Secretary, Mr. Foreign Minister. Madam Secretary, my\\nquestion is about the ongoing investigation into last week\\'s attack at the consulate in Benghazi.\\nYou are meeting this afternoon with members of Congress to discuss the progress and the\\nconcerns that they understandably have. First, there is the federal mandate to establish an\\naccountability review board. Have you done so? Who would you like to see chair it? Are there\\ncertain questions that you desperately want to have answered in order to safeguard the safety of\\nForeign Service Officers around the world?\\nAnd related to this, given the political instability and the successes of the past year and a half, are\\nyou satisfied that in light of those political changes, enough was done to protect those working in\\nthe Middle East and North Africa? And then finally â€” and this is perhaps going into the area of\\nrumor and speculation â€” but there is at least one report suggesting that Ambassador Stevens felt\\nthat he was on a, quote, \"al-Qaida hit list\" Is this a scurrilous rumor? Is this gallows humor\\nwhen one is working in a period of difficulty and great challenge, or is there something more to\\nwhat he allegedly â€” and I stress that word â€” said?\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739812\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

I will be briefing in two separate sessions, the House and the Senate, in\\na classified setting, along with my interagency colleagues, as we continue to work together, and\\nwith governments around the world, to ensure that our people and our facilities are safe. I will be\\njoined today by the Director of National Intelligence, General Clapper, by the Deputy Secretary\\nof Defense, Ash Carter, by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Sandy Winnefeld,\\nalong with experts from the FBI, the State Department, and elsewhere in the government.\\nNow, I anticipate that this briefing will cover our security posture before and during the events,\\nand the steps we have taken since to do everything we can with host governments to protect our\\npeople and our embassies and consulates. The Director of National Intelligence will speak to the\\nintelligence issues surrounding these events in Libya. Deputy Secretary Carter will brief on the\\nsuperb support we have had from the U.S. military in the wake of these events, and we are at the\\nvery early stages of an FBI investigation. The team from the FBI reached Libya earlier this week.\\nAnd I will advise Congress also that I am launching an accountability review board that will be\\nchaired by Ambassador Thomas Pickering.\\nI will also talk about the importance of the broader relationships with these countries in light of\\nthe events of the past days. There are obviously very real challenges in these new democracies,\\nthese fragile societies, but as I said last week, the vast majority of the people in these countries\\ndid not throw off the tyranny of a dictator to trade it for the tyranny of a mob. And we are\\nconcerned first and foremost with our own people and facilities, but we are concerned about the\\ninternal security in these countries because ultimately, that puts at risk the men, women, and\\nchildren of these societies on a daily ongoing basis if actions are not taken to try to restore\\nsecurity and civil order.\\nAnd let me just conclude by saying that there can be no doubt where the United States stands.\\nWe continue to support those who are fighting for universal values â€” values that we see at work\\nin Indonesia â€” the third largest democracy in the world. We believe that these values of universal\\nrights, of justice and accountability, of democracy, are there for every person regardless of where\\nthat person might live. So I will look forward to having a chance to talk with members of\\nCongress.\\nAs to your final question, I have absolutely no information or reason to believe that there\\'s any\\nbasis for that.\\nQUESTION: Thank you.\\nMS.

If it\\'s continuing happen, it\\'s â€”\\nobviously could give impact to the implementation of (inaudible) program in Indonesia. What is\\nthe reason U.S. Government closed the Embassy and Consulate in Indonesia? What is your\\nexpectation from Indonesia Government, for my Minister Marty Natalegawa? How Indonesia\\nGovernment respond to the closing of this Embassy and Consulate, it\\'s starting today? Is U.S. â€”\\nIndonesia Government has capability to protect U.S. Embassy and Consulate. So the (inaudible)\\nprogram implemented â€” could be implemented successfully in Indonesia. Thank you.\\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Well, let me begin by saying how grateful we are for the excellent\\ncooperation we have received from the Government of Indonesia, and in particular, from the law\\nenforcement and security institutions in Indonesia. We are very grateful for not only the\\ncooperation and protection that has been provided to our facilities, but also to the strong\\nstatements condemning violence from the President, the Foreign Mihister, and others.\\nIn consultation with the Government of Indonesia, we have temporarily, for tomorrow, closed\\nour facilities. We want to be sure that law enforcement in Indonesia has the ability to do what it\\nneeds to do to make sure that there is no disruption of civil order and security. So we are\\ncooperating completely, and we\\'re very grateful for the strong leadership provided by Indonesia.\\nFOREIGN MINISTER NATALEGAWA: Hello, (inaudible), if I may just also respond.\\nPrecisely as the Secretary had said, the decision by the United States Government to close\\ntemporarily its embassies and consulates tomorrow in Indonesia is a decision that\\'s been made\\nbased on communication and conversation between the authorities in Indonesia and the United\\nStates as well. So in other words, it is an informed decision, a decision that is not intended to\\nshow any unfriendly intent on the part of anyone, but it is what it is, and it\\'s quite some â€” it\\'s the\\nkind of step that governments actually carry out when situations requires it, even in our case.\\nSome of our embassies abroad, when the situation requires us to have a temporary closing of the\\nembassy, we do that as well. So it is something that is quite regular and something that is\\nactually coordinated as well.\\nBut if I may just broaden the subject matter, I think as our President had said in the past,\\nIndonesian Government the Indonesian people, even, obviously cannot and would not condone\\nthe â€” any acts of violence against diplomatic premises, against diplomatic personnel, because\\nthat is, truly â€” would be a challenge to the efficient and a proper conduct of relations among\\nstates. So that\\'s our point of departure.\\nAt the same time, of course, beyond the immediate issue of protection of the embassies, we have\\nstill ahead of us the challenge of how to prevent the kind of situations where we are now at in\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739812\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

We\\'ve had the opportunity to meet in Islamabad and other\\nsettings, but I am very pleased that we would have this chance to exchange views on our bilateral\\nrelationship as well as regional and global issues.\\nI want to begin by addressing the events of the day and the past week. Today, we\\'ve once again\\nseen protests in several cities in Pakistan. Unfortunately, some of those protests have turned\\nviolent and, sadly, resulted in loss of life. I want to thank the Government of Pakistan for their\\nefforts to protect our Embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Lahore, Peshawar, and Karachi.\\nAnd I want to be clear, as I have said on numerous occasions, the violence we have seen cannot\\nbe tolerated. There is no justification for violence. Of course, there is provocation, and we have\\ncertainly made clear that we do not in any way support provocation. We found the video that\\'s at\\nthe core of this series of events offensive, disgusting, reprehensible.\\nBut that does not provide justification for violence, and therefore it is important for responsible\\nleaders, indeed responsible people everywhere, to stand up and speak out against violence and\\nparticularly against those who would exploit this difficult moment to advance their own\\nextremist ideologies.\\nYesterday afternoon when I briefed the Congress, I made it clear that keeping our people\\neverywhere in the world safe is our top priority. What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist\\nattack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who\\nmurdered four Americans. And we are taking aggressive measures at all of our posts to protect\\nour staffs and their families along with locally employed people who provide so many important\\ncontributions to the work of our missions.\\nThe Foreign Minister and I will have a chance to cover a full range of subjects today, and it is no\\nsecret that the past year and a half has been challenging for Pakistan and the United States. And\\nwe still have work to do to get our bilateral relationship to the point where we would like it to be,\\nbut we both recognize that we can achieve more when we work together on a focused agenda.

I look forward to seeing President Zardari next week\\nat the UN General Assembly. At each meeting, we are working to identify the strategic goals we\\nshare â€” and there are many â€” and the concrete actions we can each take to accomplish them.\\nOur number one shared priority remains pursuing our joint counterterrorism objectives to ensure\\nthe security of American and Pakistani citizens alike. We face a common threat from a common\\nenemy, and we must confront terrorism and extremism together. Earlier this month, I designated\\nthe Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization so we could make full use of every\\navailable legal authority to end their deadly attacks. Pakistan\\'s parliament has called for\\nexpelling foreign fighters so that Pakistan\\'s territory can be fully under control of the Pakistani\\nGovernment and cannot be used to launch attacks against other nations.\\nAnd the follow-through on this is challenging but necessary, and we look forward to working\\nwith Pakistan as they continue to address these problems. We have both pledged to support a\\nsecure, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan, which is vital for the security of the region. And I\\nwant to thank Foreign Minister Khar for Pakistan\\'s reopening of the NATO supply lines to allow\\nthe movement of goods to Afghanistan.\\nWe will discuss the successful first meeting of the Safe Passage Working Group in Islamabad\\nwhich brought together Afghan, Pakistani, and U.S. representatives to advance the peace process\\nin Afghanistan. The Pakistani Government\\'s public call for insurgents to come forward and talk\\nwith the Afghan Government was particularly important. We are ready to work together to build\\non these steps, and we will continue our discussions through bilateral consultations and the U.S.-\\nAfghanistan-Pakistan Core Group.\\nNow, of course, our relationship goes far beyond our shared security concerns, and today we will\\ndiscuss the many other ways in which we work together, particularly to create economic\\nopportunity for Pakistanis. Foreign Minister Khar and I agree that we need to shift our economic\\nrelationship from aid to trade and investment. We are working to help Pakistan attract more\\nprivate sector investment. We hope to finalize a bilateral investment treaty soon. And we\\'ve\\ncreated a Pakistan private investment initiative to help more of Pakistan\\'s small and medium\\nsized companies get access to capital.\\nOver the past few years, we have seen Pakistan\\'s civilian government begin to put down stronger\\nroots. And if elections proceed as planned next year, it will mark the first time in Pakistan\\'s\\nhistory that a civilian-led government has served its full term. The United States supports\\nPakistan\\'s economic development, and we have said many times that we want to see democracy\\nsucceed in Pakistan.\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739812\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

There is no higher priority for President Obama and\\nmyself than the safety of our people. We\\'ve taken a number of steps around the world to\\naugment security and to protect our personnel at diplomatic posts. And we are working closely\\nwith host governments in this effort.\\nAs I have said before and as is embodied in the Vienna Convention and other international\\nagreements, all governments have the duty, the solemn duty, to defend diplomatic missions.\\nThey must be safe and protected places so that governments can exchange views and work on\\nmany important issues, and leaders across the world must stand up and be counted in rejecting\\nviolence and holding violent actors accountable.\\nWe are working closely with the Government of Tunisia They have assisted us in enhancing the\\nsecurity of our facilities. We\\'ve also discussed with them the imperative of bringing to justice\\nthose responsible for these violent attacks. And we have offered and will continue to look for\\nways that we can assist the new Government of Tunisia in ensuring the rule of law throughout\\ntheir country, first and foremost for the people of Tunisia themselves. We look forward to\\ncontinuing to build our hew partnership with the Tunisian Government and people. Our\\nrelationship is built around the shared principles of all democracies â€” a commitment to\\nnonviolence, to tolerance, and inclusivity for all people, and to upholding the rule of law.\\nThe Tunisian people have bravely put themselves on the road to democracy. They were the first\\nof the Arab revolutions and they have made important progress in a very short period of time.\\nThey have worked too hard and sacrificed too much over too many years to see their progress\\nhijacked at derailed by extremists with Ulric own a5,-.\\n,\\n,encia.
